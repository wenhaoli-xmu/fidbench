Discuss the intervals where it is increasing or decreasing, find all its critical points, inflection points, and describe the concavity of the function. Also, explain the implications of the first and second derivative tests and use them to classify all local maxima, minima, and saddle points. Present a detailed breakdown of each step in your reasoning process, including all necessary calculus and algebraic manipulations."}]}

Determine whether it converges absolutely, conditionally, or diverges. Provide a detailed analysis using convergence tests such as the Alternating Series Test, the Comparison Test, and the Limit Comparison Test. Break down each step logically and justify the use of each test with mathematical rigor."}]}

The cost of the material for the side of the can is $0.02 per square centimeter, and the cost for the top and bottom is $0.03 per square centimeter. Formulate the cost function in terms of radius and height, then use calculus to determine the dimensions that will minimize the cost. Provide a complete mathematical justification for your answer."}]}
