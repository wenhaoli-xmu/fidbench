{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Describe the biochemical pathway of cellular respiration in eukaryotic cells in detail, covering glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Explain the role of each enzyme complex, ATP yield, and the function of NADH and FADH2. Include reactions, organelles involved, and regulation mechanisms."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Cellular respiration starts with glycolysis in the cytoplasm, where glucose is converted to pyruvate, yielding 2 ATP and 2 NADH. Pyruvate enters the mitochondria, converted to acetyl-CoA, entering the Krebs cycle, which occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. Each turn produces 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, and 1 ATP. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 feed into the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Complexes Iâ€“IV facilitate electron transfer and pump protons, generating a gradient used by ATP synthase (Complex V) to produce ~34 ATP. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor. Regulation includes allosteric inhibition of phosphofructokinase by ATP and citrate."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the process of DNA replication in prokaryotic cells, including the roles of DNA polymerase III, helicase, primase, ligase, and single-stranded binding proteins. How does the replication fork operate, and what are the differences between leading and lagging strand synthesis?"}]}
