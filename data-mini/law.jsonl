When we resigned the lease August 2016, we wrote into the lease that an in-unit washer and dryer would be installed by September 30th 2016.  Since September 30th, there have been continuous delays in getting the W/D installed. Since it has now been almost a month past the date the W/D was supposed to be installed, I am wondering what types of rights as a tenant I have?   Thanks ahead of time for any and all advice given."}]}

It was a spur of the moment \"I hate trying to find a hook, I'm just gonna get it decisions.   Is there anything I can do to prevent, or remove myself from the list of registered users?   Will that make a difference? If not, can I move out to make sure it doesn't disrupt my mom's daycare? She loves her kinds and spends so much time with them. I know she loves them like family. She's even a godmother to who was then a stranger.  Can really use your help reddit!  any suggestions on where else to post?  Thanks!"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Short story: I went to jail for a week, met a really nice guy. We became great friends inside. Just before his first kid was born, he was arrested for a small distribution charge. Now one of the nicest guys I know can\\'t watch his kid grow up because of a stupid mistake.  He sold a small amount of heroin to a friend because he had tried heroin and didn\\'t want to ever take it again because fear of addiction. He was caught, and sent to 15 years in prison with 9 suspended. He wants to get a reconsideration for a shorter sentence since he\\'s learned his lesson and just wants to be with his family. Every lawyer they try and get, the need money up front and his mom can\\'t afford it. He\\'s completed the \"Alpha\" program at jail and even has a letter from judge saying if he can get bridged back into court it was likely they would shorten his sentence.  What can we do to help him? I talk to his family all the time, trust me, this guy got the shit end of the stick of justice, taking a kids dad away is way too harsh of a punishment for something so stupid. I know \"he broke the law he has to deal with it\" is common among stories like these, but rest aside all moral opinions on that. He doesn\\'t deserve 6 more years of his life for a mistake."}]}
