{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "this is the content not showing up in the chat history- let me know if it is too much: Question: We are ramping up and separating our residential service and install business at accurate door because workflows and competencies are different than our commercial workflow. We will need a project plan, sample text notifications, samples of short and pointed marketing language, hiring plan, along with SMART goals, plus any other items you can imagine in a project of this scope. Some details you need to know- we are creating total visibility between the office, field technician, and customer. In traditional home service businesses there is a knowledge and communication gap between the office dispatching the call and technician collecting payment.  This causes miscommunication, preventable return calls, frustration for all parties, especially the customer, and stress for leadership or management.  We want to promise the customer total visibility between them and our processes, 2 experts on every call, a service concierge for every call, higher value with lower costs, faster resolution, at least 3 dependable options for the repair of existing garage doors or installation of new doors. And much more. We plan on using smart glasses and remote experts who we are right now calling service concierges, but that position name is debatable. Internally we are calling them desk techs. The important part is they are trained experts who are using 'see what I see' technology to ensure accountability for promises made, quality of work performed, speed of work performed, frictionless buying experiences, while reducing time and dollar costs to them. It is foundation for our customer journey and out technician career journey. It will allow us to build a larger customer base and hire new people almost at will as it will reduce training times and expense to the business. Can you help me get started on a plan to do this project and recommend language that communicates this to existing team and each new customer? \nAnswer: Sure, I can help you get started on a plan to separate your residential service and install business and create total visibility between the office, field technician, and customer.

This can include phrases such as \"total visibility,\" \"2 experts on every call,\" \"faster resolution,\" and \"frictionless buying experience.\"\n\nDevelop a hiring plan: Identify the skills and qualifications required for the new positions of service concierge and desk tech. Develop a recruitment strategy and an onboarding plan for new hires.\n\nSet SMART goals: Develop specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals for the project.

I libri dicono questo, ma loro non vogliono vedere quella parte.\n\n00:00:53:12 - 00:01:03:01\nDovresti capire il vero potere che risuona dentro di te, e dovresti essere in grado di comandare la tua realtà, comandare alle cose di esistere.\n\n00:01:03:01 - 00:01:06:23\nE non significa che vai in giro con una bacchetta magica creando pianeti e cose del genere.\n\n00:01:06:23 - 00:01:14:01\nMa significa che viviamo in un universo frattale e frattale significa fondamentalmente che tu sei una piccola parte del tutto.\n\n00:01:14:01 - 00:01:16:26\nPer renderlo molto semplice e non diventare troppo scientifico e troppo tecnico.\n\n00:01:16:26 - 00:01:28:00\nNon voglio perderti con le parole.

Può solo raccogliere dati.\n\n00:02:58:19 - 00:03:06:14\nE ritrasmette quei dati al cervello, che è racchiuso nella completa oscurità, e il tuo cervello risolve tutto e poi proietta l'ologramma su cosa sta succedendo là fuori.\n\n00:03:06:14 - 00:03:10:01\nE navighi attraverso il matrix basandoti su quell'ologramma.\n\n00:03:10:01 - 00:03:15:20\nEd è così che azionate e manovrate il corpo del vostro avatar attraverso questo campo elettromagnetico che chiamiamo terza dimensione.\n\n00:03:15:20 - 00:03:30:24\nTutto esiste solo come onde elettromagnetiche fino a quando l'osservatore cosciente fa collassare le vibrazioni, che sono informazioni, a una vibrazione più lenta, che ora possiamo identificare come materia o solidità, ma in verità la solidità e la materia anche la distanza è tutta un'illusione.\n\n00:03:30:24 - 00:03:40:15\nMa quando dico che sei Dio, devi capire che hai gli stessi poteri di comando di un'energia divina solo in una forma molto piccola e frattalizzata all'interno del tuo stesso corpo.\n\n00:03:40:15 - 00:03:45:10\nE quando capisci questo capisci che devi muoverti con forza ed energia nella terza dimensione.\n\n00:03:45:10 - 00:03:56:25\nNon puoi entrare nella terza dimensione e muoverti attraverso questo matrix con una mentalità debole, con la mentalità dell'elemosina, della speranza, del desiderio, della disperazione e del dubbio, quelle sono vibrazioni a bassa frequenza.\n\n00:03:56:25 - 00:03:58:29\nDevi aumentare le tue vibrazioni.\n\n00:03:58:29 - 00:04:02:00\nDevi comandare questo universo, devi vivere con potere.\n\n00:04:02:00 - 00:04:05:00\nQuando entri in una stanza dovresti sentire il potere.\n\n00:04:05:00 - 00:04:07:28\nDovresti avere il potere che esce da te ed arriva dentro di te.\n\n00:04:07:28 - 00:04:19:06\nQuando devi effettuare una transazione commerciale, dovresti operare con una mentalità di potere. \"Ordino che questa transazione d'affari vada a mio favore.\"\n\n00:04:19:06 - 00:04:25:03\n“Che funzionerà a mio favore. Che mi avvantaggia in un modo che mi consente di progredire in ciò che sto cercando di realizzare.\n\n00:04:25:03 - 00:04:32:27\nQuesti sono i tipi di mentalità. Quando entri in una transazione in questo modo, con una mentalità di potere positivo, una mentalità di potere con l'universo,\n\n00:04:32:27 - 00:04:35:15\nnon una mentalità debole di accattonaggio. \"Oh, spero che funzioni.\"\n\n00:04:35:15 - 00:04:39:26\n\"Oh, spero che questo accada per me.\" Questa mentalità porterà a scarsi risultati.\n\n00:04:39:26 - 00:04:43:19\nQuesto è quello che sto cercando di dirvi ragazzi, quando dico che siete dei. Il potere è dentro di voi.\n\n00:04:43:19 - 00:04:47:13\nDovete imparare a comandarlo, comandare alle cose di esistere.\n\n00:04:47:13 - 00:04:50:06\nE volete un esempio molto semplice di questo?\n\n00:04:50:06 - 00:04:55:09\nVi darò un po' reali, semplici esempi in modo che possiate capire quello che sto dicendo.\n\n00:04:55:09 - 00:05:04:21\nIl cellulare che sto usando in questo momento per parlare con voi ragazzi, questo cellulare era un concetto, un pensiero nel cervello di qualcuno.\n\n00:05:04:21 - 00:05:11:23\nQuindi, prima che questo cellulare fosse qui in forma fisica, nella terza dimensione, era un pensiero nel cervello di qualcuno.\n\n00:05:11:23 - 00:05:21:09\nQualcuno ha pensato a questo potenziale telefono, alla forma, alle misure, alle dimensioni, a come sarebbe stato, che tipo di schermo avrebbe avuto, quali sarebbero state le funzioni.\n\n00:05:21:09 - 00:05:25:24\nE si sono concentrati su di esso. E ci hanno pensato nella loro mente, hanno pensato e pensato e pensato.\n\n00:05:25:24 - 00:05:28:29\nHanno detto, ok, questo è ciò che voglio manifestare ora.\n\n00:05:28:29 - 00:05:33:21\nQuindi hanno preso questo pensiero, e lo hanno trasmesso a chi?\n\n00:05:33:21 - 00:05:40:23\nAd un progettista tecnologico, che poi lo ha portato in una forma bidimensionale inserendolo in un foglio e anche in un computer.\n\n00:05:40:23 - 00:05:43:11\nOra è un rendering bidimensionale di un pensiero.\n\n00:05:43:11 - 00:05:53:23\nQuindi quel pensiero si è ora manifestato da una piattaforma di coscienza in un piano operativo di piattaforma tridimensionale ma bidimensionale.\n\n00:05:53:23 - 00:05:58:22\nE poi da quel piano bidimensionale, un ingegnere lo prende e lo converte in un oggetto tridimensionale.\n\n00:05:58:22 - 00:06:04:07\nQuindi i tuoi pensieri iniziano sul piano cosciente,\n\n00:06:04:07 - 00:06:12:18\nfiniscono in un piano bidimensionale, e questo serve per creare oggetti che utilizziamo nella terza dimensione. Tutto, dalla tua macchina ai tuoi vestiti, a tutto ciò che è artificiale.\n\n00:06:12:18 - 00:06:14:06\nTutto inizia nello stesso processo.\n\n00:06:14:06 - 00:06:22:13\nPiano cosciente, piano bidimensionale verso un piano tridimensionale, un oggetto tridimensionale che può effettivamente essere toccato fisicamente, raccolto e manovrato nella terza dimensione.\n\n00:06:22:13 - 00:06:26:23\nTutto inizia con cosa? Un pensiero.\n\n00:06:26:23 - 00:06:34:12\nQuindi quando dico alle persone che siamo Dio e che abbiamo il potere di creare e loro ridono, dubitano e dicono, sei pazzo.\n\n00:06:34:12 - 00:06:46:00\nBene, se non fosse vero allora, non avresti nemmeno un cellulare con cui parlare con me perché la persona che ha pensato al cellulare che tieni in mano proprio in questo secondo, ha creato quel cellulare dal pensiero alla manifestazione nel terza dimensione.\n\n00:06:46:00 - 00:06:50:15\nE lo facciamo con ogni singola cosa che abbiamo che è fatta dall'uomo, letteralmente.\n\n00:06:50:15 - 00:06:57:29\nNon mi interessa cosa sia. Qualcuno ha pensato alla forma e alle dimensioni di una scatola, e cosa è successo? Si è manifestata nella realtà tridimensionale.\n\n00:06:57:29 - 00:07:05:29\nQualcuno ha pensato alla forma e alle dimensioni di un veicolo su cui qualcuno può sedersi e viaggiare. E cosa è successo? Si è manifestato nella realtà tridimensionale.\n\n00:07:05:29 - 00:07:10:22\nTutto ciò che abbiamo che è fatto dall'uomo è iniziato sotto forma di pensiero. Come sopra così sotto.\n\n00:07:10:22 - 00:07:15:16\nProprio come il creatore di questo universo è un creatore che crea costantemente.\n\n00:07:15:16 - 00:07:26:10\nBene, indovinate un po' ragazzi? Come sopra così sotto. Abbiamo lo stesso identico tipo di sistema dell'energia del creatore. Ed è per questo che anche noi stessi creiamo su base coerente,\n\n00:07:26:10 - 00:07:30:13\ngli esseri umani creano ogni singolo giorno, sette giorni alla settimana, 24 ore al giorno.\n\n00:07:30:13 - 00:07:31:25\nNoi creiamo, creiamo, creiamo, creiamo.\n\n00:07:31:25 - 00:07:37:13\nSe non lo facessimo, qui non ci sarebbe niente. Vivremmo nudi in una caverna.\n\n00:07:37:13 - 00:07:46:25\nE non lo stiamo facendo. Stiamo operando e muovendoci attraverso questo matrix utilizzando la tecnologia e le cose che abbiamo creato per noi stessi, come strumenti e vestiti\n\n00:07:46:25 - 00:07:53:12\ne automobili, aeroplani e tecnologia di tutti i diversi tipi. Come mai? Perché ci abbiamo pensato\n\n00:07:53:12 - 00:08:01:00\nsul piano cosciente, poi si è spostato in un piano bidimensionale, e poi da lì è entrato in una terza dimensione, nella realtà fisica.\n\n00:08:01:00 - 00:08:02:19\nQuindi siamo creatori.\n\n00:08:02:19 - 00:08:07:09\nQuindi, quando ti dico che hai Dio dentro, quella è l'energia divina che ti permette di creare.\n\n00:08:07:09 - 00:08:12:01\nLa gente dà per scontato che abbiamo tutta questa roba.\n\n00:08:12:01 - 00:08:18:12\nNo amico. Tu sei un creatore. Ognuno di noi ha il potere di creare. Tu sei Dio.\n\n00:08:18:12 - 00:08:22:01\nPunto. Capiscilo. Usalo.\n\n00:08:22:01 - 00:08:25:11\nDovete comprendere che il potere che è già dentro di voi ragazzi.\n\n00:08:25:11 - 00:08:27:02\nE poi vedrete di cosa sto parlando.\n\n00:08:27:02 - 00:08:30:18\nCapirete il messaggio esoterico che sto cercando di trasmettervi."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "3 / 4\"Organize this transcript into a detailed status report; listing all people on the call, any topics discussed and sub bullets of action items raised, thoughts, comments, concerns and opportunities moving forward.\"\nThis report should be a resource for anyone to read and understand what the key points were.\n\n\n \nShirin Safavy\n00:34\nso as far as our agenda for today i'll walk us through\nour goals and objectives. From this past year\ni'll cover an executive summary our accomplishments together.\nand then we'll talk through campaign performance.\nand Sandy will take over from there and walk through some insights and learnings, and\nwe'll wrap up with opportunities and next steps.\nSo our biggest goal for 2022 was to create awareness of the Qsp Partner program\nspecifically talking to the Isv.\nAnd Msp audiences, which was something that has not been done before\n \nShirin Safavy\n01:51\nSo our end goal\nfor this year was to increase partner sales of the cute\nquickbook solutions.\nwe also wanted to create some educational opportunities for partners so that they could more effectively market and sell these solutions, especially the quick books online solution.\nAnd i'm not gonna read through everything. There's a lot to talk through today. So if there's something you see on here that we didn't cover\nfeel free to ask about that\nlater in the meeting.\nSo in 2,022, we provided over 5,700 new leads we did this by developing and launching lead Gen. Programs for partner recruitment\nand through partner marketing\nwe managed a total of 16 webinars, including the execution\nwhich freed up a lot of time for Gina and her team.\nWe hosted and developed marketing best practices content, and we did this\nfor 7 monthly meet the expert series.\nand we also refined the Isv. And msp messaging, so that we can better address the needs of those audiences.\nSo what did we accomplish?\nI just mentioned that we generated over 5,700 leads.\nhere's how they break down. So 3 300 of those were generated for Isv.\nMs. P. For the partner recruitment.\nand a little over 2,400 leads were through Webinar registrations\nand Content Syndication programs.\nWe also created a newsletter in Mailchim. This was for leads that had completed the nurture, but didn't convert\nand traffic on the on 24 site pages were significantly increased so previously. They were a little under 200\nper week.\nand they have increased to over a 1,000 per week.\nAs far as nurture campaigns. We developed 2 separate tracks with 5 touches each one for ISP and one for Msp.\nThese were sent out on a weekly cadence, and began in April of 2,022\nas you can see below. Under the offer column we used a variety of assets.\nUnfortunately, we'd already use the existing ebook for Content Syndication, so we used a mix of blogs, case studies and\npapers\nfor these 5 touches.\nHere on the right, we have a couple of samples of these emails. One for is one for Msp.\nThe metrics for the ISP\nnurture track were to get significantly higher.\nYou can see the numbers here are well above industry standard averages, and as far as the Msp. Audience goes\nthese rates. They're not bad. They're just closer to the standards of the industry.\n \nSandi Settle\n05:18\nYeah, I think there's an opportunity here for us to work on the messaging for the Msps. That's one thing to point out to to kind of dial that in a little bit better.\n \nHoward Sewell\n05:26\nExactly. I I will stress, if I may just jump in. I you know, I think of industry standards, for a houseless like this is sort of, you know, 10 to 15% somewhere in there as being kind of, you know, a to good.\nSo 20% is nothing to be ashamed of or the click rate for that matter. But we've set ourselves a high bar, which is which is great, and and there's always room for for testing and optimization.\n \nAnila Baseel\n05:53\nI think these are great numbers. because the average industry rate for the open rate, it's not 20% right. It's probably less than that.\n \nHoward Sewell\n06:01\nYeah, definitely.\nYep. Exactly.\n \nGina Madson\n06:04\nYeah. And we're excited as we go into this next year we're going to have a lot more content. Both success stories and testimonials. So I think I hope that new, fresh, engaging content, especially a lot of video content will also play into better click through rates and the nurtures as well.\n \nAnila Baseel\n06:24\nAnd you know, I would add this because we probably need to start thinking about franchise, too.\non that.\nYeah, it's a big opportunity here. So we should talk about that for sure.\n \nGina Madson\n06:37\nOkay.\n \nSandi Settle\n06:40\nwe're here to help Gina.\n \nShirin Safavy\n06:46\nSo another accomplishment where the office hours webinars these consisted of spear speakers.\nUnfortunately, we don't have data for the earlier sessions. But we have really good data for the past 3 months, and we'll continue\nto have that in the future. So we can compare each session to the last.\n \nSandi Settle\n07:07\nYeah. Our hope is also to do some serving of your partners to see what they want to learn more about, and the type of content that they're interested in. But we'll build out a series for next year.\nWith that information, I think we're slated for February for our first one\n \nUnknown Speaker\n07:25\nfor 2,023.\n \nShirin Safavy\n07:26\nYes, that's correct.\nAnd here are some samples of the partner creatives These are the emails we sent through our third party partner\nand promoted through content. Syndication.\nyou can see at the top we use dual logos. So the quick books logo is always at the top right, and the partner Logo is on the left.\nWe strategically chose images that fit each industry. And you can see below in these samples we played around with the buttons to determine\nwhere\nthe best performance is. based on button placement, and determine that\nthe 2 green ones top placement performs best.\n \nAnila Baseel\n08:11\nand do we have numbers on how the messaging may have done like between. Notify Mendelssohn and margin Edge, like what resonated better with the audience.\n \nSandi Settle\n08:23\nWell, their audiences are a bit different because they're different industries. For the most part we can go back and analyze and take a look at them.\n \nAnila Baseel\n08:32\nI know we did a series. We did more for some of the partners than others, so we don't have as much to kind of compare to, but we can look at that, because we have the data and the performance, and each of them I'm asking is like, I see one of them is Nsp. Mandelson. The rest are. Is these\nWhat the feedback we got from is this was that they're looking more for us to do a\ncustomization approach in terms of messaging.\nThey have their own solution integrated to quick books. We have our own. So how do we make that peanut butter, jelly, sandwich kind of thing approach right with is. so i'm just wondering if one of them resonated better where we have more of a connected messaging.\n \nSandi Settle\n09:18\nOkay.\nwe'll take a look at that.\n \nGina Madson\n09:22\nYeah, I know for notify and margin edge we provide spear with the co-value proposition\n \nAnila Baseel\n09:28\ncontent and messaging. So yeah, it'd be curious to see if we do better with those that you guys did. we are working towards that Co. Marketing messaging. Okay?\n \nSandi Settle\n09:44\nWell, I think you'll see some of that. a little Further, we have a surprise to show you.\n \nShirin Safavy\n09:54\nOkay, and moving on to the part Prospect Partner Newsletter. So\nthe data below is for the first issue, which went out pretty recently on November first.\nclicks look good click to open rates look pretty great.\nSo\n \nSandi Settle\n10:12\nthe one thing we learned from this is we obviously need more content. So some of this is is also reaching out or utilizing some industry content as well. For educational purposes that we think you know they would be interested in, but we'd love more.\nI\ninto it related content.\nfor these newsletters moving forward.\n \nAnila Baseel\n10:36\nSorry I, my mindful, but I mentioned here. I think this for recruit. Probably.\nso. I almost feel like in the title is grabbing their attention because quick books is a big name. That's the o open rate that shows is.\n \nSandi Settle\n10:54\nand the CTO. Specifically, which is great\n \nAnila Baseel\n10:58\nWonder if we can align. And this is our problem. If we can align those leads to how we closed internally, or I'll be the right ones.\n \nGina Madson\n11:10\nSo this is the the Newsletter that we just started sending monthly Anila, and it's going to the long term nurture. So the leads that have already gone through sales and haven't converted yet so that this kind of like our drip continuing to message to them.\nso we've only yeah. I had the last month, really. And then the second one went out the beginning of December. But that's for sure something we're trying to track internally, and you know, like pass over. If someone re-engages\nand starts to raise our hand at the bottom of every Newsletter. It's a call to action to, you know, book time with LED basically so we're trying to promote that with these.\n \nAnila Baseel\n11:50\nSo, Gina, we don't know how many we got through meetings with LED\n \nGina Madson\n11:54\nas of this one. I don't believe any have been booked with end from the Newsletter right now, because they're overly a newsletter, and they're like, Wait, this is this is nothing. So we\nagain, if if it was all a 100% Qsp. Content, and they may not feel relevant either. So we need to\nchange up the mix of content. We had, you know, more industry, available news and\ncontent available. So that's kind of what we use, but\nthat isn't the plan long term.\n \nSandi Settle\n12:26\nRight?\n \nUnknown Speaker\n12:32\nOkay?\n \nShirin Safavy\n12:34\nOkay. So this chart on the right shows engagement time on the\npartner sites between February and October of this year.\nYou can see the time on the site is pretty low. It's not where we want to be. We want to increase engagement to keep people coming back.\nSo that is definitely something. We'll continue to work on\n \nSandi Settle\n12:59\nOne thing to call out there to the time on site\nwill help with refreshing, you know. As we get more content they'll have more reason to come back more frequently to, you know, spend time on site. They\nright now we're using the site more to come for one purpose like to register for something, and then they pop off. What we want to do is is, keep them there. Keep them looking, going deeper into the site, and so forth. So\nwe have talked to Gina about, you know, building out. Maybe some industry pages and things like that. what we can do as far as promotion of that site is limited because it's on on 24\nSomething to think about in the future is potentially building it like a micro site or something that we could actually do some social promotion to\nwe're limited in that now, but content is a big factor in keeping them there\n \nGina Madson\n13:54\nright. This is our on 24 hub, so it's not a main website. but it's where our lower content and our Webinar registrations are housed. So\nnot\nexactly a main partner website, but that is something that's in the works for\nfor next year. What I was also thinking right for future discussion is.\n \nAnila Baseel\n14:15\nwe have this. We're also internally working on our quickbooks.com site\nto add partner specific page, and we have to drive that page also. So when you talk about a micro site\nthat could be a gateway coming into our quick books. Right? so we can drive traffic one. Another driver would be our directory. So we're hoping to get that more robust, and that's going to be our partners outward facing to customers.\nOkay. So how do we help them generate on the for marketing piece there? Also?\n \nUnknown Speaker\n14:58\nOkay.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:01\nSorry. Taking notes.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:05\nI think it is important to note just looking at this chart here that visitors have been increasing.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:11\nSo, we're headed in the right direction.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:14\nAnd\nnow that we're seeing momentum with visitors, we just want to keep them there longer and keep them coming back.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:23\nExactly.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:28\nOh, now it's happening again.\n \nSandi Settle\n15:30\nI\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:31\nThere we go.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:37\nOkay.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:38\nSo campaign. Sorry, guys.\nit's like it knows everybody is on this. Call it doesn't want to cooperate.\nSo looking at the nurture campaign results, As I mentioned earlier, we had 2 separate tracks, 5 touches each.\nYou can see we're pretty close to industry averages. Those are listed at the very bottom of this chart.\nSome touches performed better than others. we've recently been working on rewriting some of this copy, so we do look forward to seeing how they'll measure in the next few months. Compared\nto these measurements.\nand the Msp. Track actually performed much better than is V. Which makes sense. When you think about it, because most of the assets we used, or\nvery closely related to Msp.\nfor example, this third touch here performed really well.\nSo.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n16:42\nhmm.\n \nShirin Safavy\n16:44\nAnother thing I wanted to point out is that in the beginning of our engagement we were sending these emails manually. So Spear was manually going into mailchimp and sending the touches out each week.\nand as we added to the series, and had a complete set of 5, we were able to recreate the nurture within mailch as an automated series.\nSo and gina i'm sure you remember that.\nSo I want to be sure that you know these numbers are based on the automated series, not the manual.\n \nGina Madson\n17:14\nOkay.\n \nShirin Safavy\n17:19\nAnd this is a summary slide of the partner Webinar programs for post-event promotion.\nThese partners receive content syndication leads after their webinar.\nAnd the reason there's no costs per lead for the first one for margin edge is because we used and make good for that project\n \nAnila Baseel\n17:42\nfor these numbers.\nI I guess I need to understand what the definition of lead is. is it just? if it is just attendees. Then let's call it out. 1 50 attendees right? Because when we'd say, when we talk about these numbers to sales, they like leads\noh, leads. They consider as qualified. So, unless we have a qualification, we should probably say attendees. The other thing is from for my team. I think we we're at a point, Gina, where we could look at these coming in. And if we, how can we\ncontinue the journey of where these are from the partner, and that's going to be a tough one.\n \nGina Madson\n18:24\nYeah. So with these ones we have report the attendees and the registrants separately. And then this was actually after the fact. After the Webinar. We syndicated it as a piece that someone could go out and register for and targeted that syndication through spears, various\nagencies right to those targeted audiences. So these leads are people that clicked on it and said, oh, I want to watch that Webinar i'm, you know, going to register. So then we pass them over to the Qsp. And they fit the audience criteria that you're looking for. Specifically.\n \nSandi Settle\n19:00\nSo\nit it's kinda in between. They've raised their hand. They're interested, and they fit the right profile as\nas a lead.\n \nGina Madson\n19:08\nright? And so the feedback we've gotten from hinge and margin edge so where I Haven't heard definitively from asterisk. But that is, these are really good quality, and that they are the contacts that they want at the companies that they want to be talking to\nbut it's been mixed as they're reaching out to them, and that that lead is like\nvery familiar with it, and understand who they are and why they're reaching out to. Okay, yeah.\nI just clicked on that. It does sound interesting to me. But why are you calling me right. So like it is definitely a top of funnel lead. But it's getting them like I said, the right people at the right companies to fill that top of funnel. Then it's up to the partner to really nurture them.\n \nAnila Baseel\n19:50\nYeah, i'm wondering if we could do anything with and lift all this and and lift it a partner that we have\nwhere you know they're looking at data and a lot of vertical specific stuff. And so, even just to understand like for margin edge, or if we bucket them into verticals, so hinge full margin edge if they do a concer i'm just making this up. I don't know construction, or you know a\ninventory management solution. What are the profiles that we're looking at? Because there's going to be a lot of partners. I see specifically that are playing in the same vertical. And so how do we segment each of their specialty into that? So that's something that we could, you know, do but i'm just mentioning to.\nGina Lexi and Louise is\nif there's an if if we can create a almost like a propensity model on for each of the verticals.\n \nHoward Sewell\n20:49\nquick question. Actually, we're going to touch upon\npropensity a little later on in the in the deck quick. This question almost for for both teams. But i'm wondering in light of Gina's comment about the mixed response to outreach. Can we help provide guidance, or maybe sample scripts, or anything to these partners, one\nfor their outreach, because we hear that a lot with content syndication programs occasionally, whether the clients where leads get thrown over the fence to sales. Sales thinks they are following up on people that have expressed interest in the product. Basically\nAnd there is so. So there is sort of like a disconnect when you know. So i'm just wondering if that's something that we can\nmaybe help\nguide in a\nin a gentle way, and improve that.\nImprove that response for sure, open to it. I mean, we are pretty\n \nGina Madson\n21:40\nclear with the marketer at the queue at the partner right? That like that's what happened. This is what happened, but i'm not there controlling how they're passing into sales, and I don't know right. I think march and edge is an exception. but for him to go I know that they don't have refined\nnurture process right and different levels of sales who would be reaching out at different times. So for sure, it's something that we can do better and enable our usps with better.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n22:13\nOkay.\n \nHoward Sewell\n22:15\ncool.\n \nSandi Settle\n22:16\nYeah, I think we'll touch on it a little further down to, as you know, some of the challenges with understanding, you know. Measurement on the back end of how they, how they're doing, and how they're, you know, moving through the funnel.\ncertainly would love to be more involved in, you know. Get more transparent feedback from them, so that we can put that into our campaigns and follow up\nyour screen.\n \nShirin Safavy\n22:45\nGreat. So I will hand things over to Sandy.\n \nSandi Settle\n22:48\nAll right next slide, please.\nSo we asked Gina upfront here. if she could do a swat analysis of our relationship.\nso that we could, you know, ensure we're giving the best service possible. You know. What do we do? Well, what can we improve? I won't. Go through and read all of this, but I wanted it as part of the deck, because it is something that we're working. You know.\nWe're keeping front of mine and working on some of the things that you mentioned, where you know we do really well at the kind of lead, generation side on content, syndication and campaign execution, working on the webinars content.\nplanning and strategy. and then I I do think our relationship between our team is is strong that communication is great.\nSome areas that we can improve our, you know, on timelines. we're actively looking at ways that we can.\nyou know, keep that. Keep the projects moving quickly, making sure that we're hitting those timelines, and we, you know we added more resources onto the account as well, and Lynn and her team have been working harder on, you know.\nrefining the the messaging and trying to get those. You know the audience messaging just right. So we're gonna continuously work on that\nand we're looking at different vendors to also to see how we can refine the audience a little bit better for you as well, and finding new ways to reach. You know your target Audience.\nnext slide, please.\n \nAnila Baseel\n24:26\nSo I just on that.\nI know Gina and I talk quite a bit and thank you for sharing the learning on the content piece. Right? I mean, I know that, you guys you've tried and stuff. But honestly, we have agencies that we work with very in a, you know, deeper workshop place, and they've been on board, and they really integrated so\nhonestly from that point of view, we could get to some of the content that we've already created. And one thing that we have put in place is Harry on our team is doing the overall messaging, and we just tap into those, you know messages, right? So we're. We are putting things in place that are better because we understand that there's different places where we are going to use that content from. So you know, there's there's improvements happening on our site as well.\n \nSandi Settle\n25:14\nOh, absolutely. We know that there there are things in place. I know some things have been stuck in legal, and there have been some challenges with people being gone, and you know, nothing moves as quickly as as we would like them to, but we definitely have probably hit\nthe end of the content that we have now. So we're eagerly awaiting, you know, new assets moving forward. But if there's ever a need to do that, and we hope to be doing that more with some of the partners themselves with the marketplace program.\nThat, you know. That would be wonderful, too, is to be able to show up to share some of that.\nwe also looked at some of the opportunities and threats just to get some feedback on the industry itself. and you know, if there's any gaps in our service, or where we could help more. and so we were listening on here. We realized that you know most of the social has moved over to corporate.\nBut if there's anything that we can do from the standpoint of creating content or posts, or anything to you know. Move that along faster. Obviously we're here for you.\nLet's see here.\nwe're doing our best to get the most out of your budget to drive new leads for the Qs themselves, and also for the partner Acquisition.\nI think here we all see that the industry is slowing slightly. and budgets are, you know.\nbeing held closely.\nbut I still think that we've seen a lot of successes, and we're able to apply that kind of moving forward to get more and more efficient at helping those partners, you know, find better ways to reach their audiences and target those messages more clearly.\nNext slide, please.\nSo overall what we think went well was the communication between our teams. You know we've had really open honest discussions, but things don't work, and when they do Gina has been great at sharing everything that she sees on her side that help, you know. Help us all do better.\nwe've had the ability to test different approaches and pivot. You know quickly when things aren't working.\nwe have some resources in place that help us, you know. Get better organized and communicate better. I think we review things very quickly. The teams got open flow of communication between the channels and the\nthe regular meetings as well. we have some flexibility and adding\nadditional resources on the sphere side when there's upticks in work. So we've brought more people onto the team, and we I think we have a solid team in place.\nNext slide, please.\nSome of the challenges we, you know we had a hard time with that live Webinar\nevent promotion upfront. We learned from that, and I think we've been able to do a lot better.\nReplacing that offer with the on demand recordings and doing the promotions on the back end. also increasing kind of the mix of content that we have to work with so ebooks and case studies and things like that. when possible. Ebooks, obviously are, are one of the\nthe pieces most in demand.\nyou we discussed the partner commitment needed to kind of complete the post event. Follow up, and maybe this is an opportunity for us to help help you help them by creating some.\nmaybe best practices, as Ha! Hey? Howard had mentioned on scripts, and, you know, follow up emails to kind of level out the playing field for those partners that may not have the resources to do that.\nWe recommended kind of the creation of some\ntop of funnel ebook assets that incorporate things like case studies or snippets and testimonials. But that has a little bit more of a thought leadership. Focus. Those do much better in the ads than you know, sending them to just landing pages to go kind of look for content themselves.\nOur lack of ebook and white paper assets kind of made some of the lead generation efforts to little challenging for contents, education and and paid media advertising.\nSo we we, as I said before, we could use a little bit more of a mix of assets to kind of freshen those nurtures, and continue with the monthly newsletters. populating those. So there's no big surprises there\nmessaging.\nyou know we did find that we need some differentiation on the messaging between the audiences. They were a little too similar, I think, as you said we're working on it. It's been getting better and better.\nthe Intuit team has provided us more information, any background such as you know, surveys or any feedback that you got from your events last week, that potentially we can kind of incorporate that into the messaging\nto make it a little bit. You know more refined\nreporting as an area that we still are having some challenges, I would say, in in measuring how we're doing from a revenue, perspective and opportunities to a generated from the programs that we're doing so potentially getting salesforce access or\nregular reporting from that could help also getting some reporting from the partners themselves\nwould be beneficial.\nthe on 24 landing pages are acceptable, but\nthe fact that there's only kind of one version of the form makes some of the lead generation that we want to do.\nyou know, unattainable we recommend, maybe designing and building additional landing pages with new forms and mailchimp potentially in that in the future\nthat will help with the lead Gen. Needs, and enable us to kind of measure more\nthat lack of engagement tracking and the results from meet the experts. As we go forward, so we can kind of see how we're doing on those that would be helpful as well.\nand let's see mailchimp, you know. Mail 10 third. There are some\nareas there where we can't quite build some of the templates that we want to Some of the modules just had to be kind of tweaked to translate\nvisually in mailchimp\nbut we were able to kind of overcome that with the newsletter\nareas of opportunity the content development is is one of those areas where\nwe could use a little mix of content for the industry pages potentially creating content that's specific to those different industries. So whether it's construction or inventory management.\nmaybe creating some more content that's specific to those industries. the potential to maybe survey or interview partners to to find topics of interest, or, you know, get some some expertise on messaging from them\nidentifying cop topics of interest from your conference. I know we haven't had a chance to talk about how it went last week, but we look forward to hearing a little bit about that\nthe creation of the partner. Videos case studies and blogs that you're talking about will be exciting. for the New Year.\npotentially refreshing. That messaging based on, you know, audience surveys or interviews. is a a potential area of opportunity, and also to extend that nurture.\nconsider, maybe adding the event in a box to the menu of services for the partners for the the partner marketplace.\nwhere, since\nmany of the partners are getting back into doing live events, maybe that's an in the area of opportunity where we can package that, like we talked about earlier in the year into a program.\nand then building a monthly program for tracking on the activities that we're doing for the partners. So maybe there's a way to incentivize the partners, maybe to send back revenue or opportunity results from those Content syndication programs and other things.\nso that we can kind of get some more 2 way feedback.\nAny questions there?\n \nUnknown Speaker\n34:08\nOkay.\n \nGina Madson\n34:09\nNot a good question. But just I think on it\ncomment for the Content development. I mean any of this is something we had talked about at different points, but as we get more Qsps and have more verticalized focused content for recruiting or finding customers, I should say, for our Qsps\nwith on 24, if we had a deeper set of content right. We could have some more of those always on kind of\n \nUnknown Speaker\n34:36\ngo ahead.\n \nGina Madson\n34:37\nGoogle as as well as complementary content syndication campaigns going that are for the vertical. So then we're getting and passing weeds for partners, right? Which I know we're not yet at from a corporate standpoint, but that's kind of an option to explore down the road.\n \nAnila Baseel\n34:55\nYeah, I actually made a note sending on and you, Haven't here is.\ncan we maybe do a a focus group with the partners right? Specifically? one. A focus group for is one for Msps and really understand. Look, this is what we've delivered so far. What?\nWhat is all the things that you\nmay use right.\nThey've been doing business before even they became our partner\nfor a long time. They know how to get leads and how we land those. So if we were to leverage that information and their expertise. How do we enable them? Maybe they might be something that you know, because we're all there with some marketers, and\nyou get into our little bubble of like, hey marketing, should we do this? But sometimes when you hear things from sales, it's a light bulb going off. Oh, wait! We could have tweaked it this way, so it'd be great, because we have a lot of activities under the belt. And so how do we create the next, you know, level of\nenablement for the partners. If that's focus group that they'll be open to and trust me. Our qs are pretty open, and their voice their opinion. It'd be great to have those, you know. Call it the suggestion. I know you already have that on your board.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n36:09\nRight?\n \nSandi Settle\n36:10\nYeah, I think that would be wonderful.\nThe more information they have, the more you know more we can refine.\nand with that said, we do have an in one idea that Howard is going to talk about with an an additional partner that we work with.\nNext slide. Please\n \nHoward Sewell\n36:29\ncut my cue. That's your cue\nI got. I got given a couple of slides, so i'd feel useful. which is very nice. yeah, i'll go through this quickly, but you know, full disclosure. Rev. Is a a very new partner relationship for us. In fact, it's, you know we Haven't even really formalized\nthe relationship. But they're a really interesting company, and one that we on the spear side.\nI think that we could leverage across a pretty broad swath of client engagements, and we're in a mode right now in the early stages where we've done a couple of little tests with a couple of clients, and we're looking to do a few more. 3.\nTo gauge how clients could leverage the the data that comes out of these tests, which i'll explain so Rev. Is a. A company. Basically it's a AI-based technology, and they build a\na model of your Icp ideal customer profile based on a list of your best customers. So you give them a list of 20 customers, and say, these are: If we had another 500 of these, that would be, that would be great, and they feed that into their model and output.\na couple of things. One is other companies that look like those same customers.\nAnd secondly, what are the common characteristics that define those companies beyond the usual pharmographic. So\ngeography, company, size, industry, etc., but also what Rev. Calls hexagraphics, which is basically information on how companies execute. So\nare they an early adopter or a late adopter? Are they focused on customer service, that sort of thing, and they also they build that model based on the list the company provides. They run it against a database of 6 million dollars, 6 million companies.\nThey identify those key characteristics, and then they also come back to us with. Here are other companies that look like\nthe companies you're telling us\nare\nyour best customers.\nIf you can go to the next slide.\nShreen. Thank you.\nso this has been. we've done this a couple of times now. In fact, we're presenting our second to another client this later this week, but it has the potential to be a useful tool, we believe, on a couple of fronts one\nit could identify other, but other Isvs and Msps that are out there that are most similar to the partners that you want best to capture and bring into the program. It may identify\nspecific.\nhigh potential segment. So we may. It may be a way to identify\nthat we didn't realise it, but the partners who sell to this type of company, or that have the certain characteristic end up being our top performing partners. And if we learn more about\nwhat makes those\npartners your best\npartners, it could help inform things like messaging and content, and and that sort of thing. So our offer to you, he says, is to is to take a list of your top partners, and literally all we need is like 20 company names in their urls.\nWe'll hand it over to Rev. They'll provide us, and there's no charge for this.\nThe 2 outputs that I mentioned. They'll give us a list of these hexagraphics that are common to those companies. The one important note. There is, the larger the companies\nthe better the insights. And we've learned this the hard way, so you know, and then it has a lot to do with web presence. So the the larger the web presence the company has, the more information Rev. Can capture, so it preferably be\npartners on the upper tiers of where you guys kind of operate, and they'll also provide us\na sample list of lookalike companies from their database.\nAnd then, if we found the data compelling, and this is completely without obligation. We could then look at.\nmaybe acquiring data from Rev. They also have a lead generation platform which operates in a similar sort of content syndication\nmodel where you go to them and say, hey, i'll a\nX amount per lead, if you can find me. Other companies that look like these partners. So again the ask is.\ngive us a list of 20 companies. We'll come back to you with some data.\nno charge for doing so. The the ask in in from our side is, Tell us what you think\nis this: is this interesting? Is this useful? Could you use it?\nIs it compelling, is it? It doesn't really tell us anything we didn't already know?\nbut it's an exercise we'd love to.\nWe'd love to run.\nand I think that's it.\n \nAnila Baseel\n41:31\nHoward. Thank you for for reviewing this with us, and the answer to your questions is all the above.\nHowever, we do have already a vendor that we work with, and we we're working with the the vendor from a sales perspective, too, because they're connected there, so that you know the partners and lift. And we we do do all of these things that you're you're mentioning with them.\n \nHoward Sewell\n41:59\nSo okay\n \nAnila Baseel\n42:00\nappreciate the opportunity.\n \nHoward Sewell\n42:02\nYeah, absolutely. And I confess it again. It's a relatively new relationship\nfor us. We were excited about it because\nit allows us to kind of\nbring some technology to bear help. Refine the kind of work that we do. Everything that Sandy and Sri have been talking about content development email creative, you know targeting, etc. So we wanted to make it available to you. If frankly, if you want to do it, even as just a point of comparison.\nyou know, next to what you're getting from the other company. That is absolutely fine, but it's entirely your your.\nyour your option.\nSo\n \nAnila Baseel\n42:39\nthank you.\n \nHoward Sewell\n42:40\nYou're welcome\n \nSandi Settle\n42:42\nnext slide, please.\nSo we put together a quick action plan. Some ideas, maybe, for next steps for you and the team to take a look at and\nlet us know. You know you want us to move forward with this, but we're move we're in the development process. Sorry i'm a little tongue tied. we're in the development process for that with the cin 7 evoke\nso potentially it's As soon as that's completed we could write some blog articles on it to show how those like integrated solutions\nhelp, you know SMS and use that in the Newsletter in the resource center.\nwe could continue to work on some new industry specific topics to fill in the gaps in the resource center in the newsletter as well.\nAnother idea is to create a short script video script for that ebook as well to use in prom promotions\nto move forward with the survey questions for partners. And maybe in this case, if we don't do the survey, we could do a workshop where we could get more, you know in depth understanding\nof partner needs, but that\nthe idea here was to get ideas on their interests and topics for the office hours, webinars, but also new content pieces.\nAnalyze those survey results and suggest and some new topics for Webinars moving forward. So these are sort of like quick hits that we've identified.\nIs there anything there that you would like to add to, or anything like?\n \nAnila Baseel\n44:30\nJust a questions being that you can talk in a minute to get ready for the other for the next meeting.\nSo for the top of the funnel, content. These should be in the mark, the marketing service catalog, because initially, we had. We had helped the partners. Now we're saying, we need to Co. Invest. So\nif we don't have the video, and I'm. I'm forgetting, Louise. If we don't have the video or the blog article, or whatever from Sphere and Msc. Then we should probably add these, and that needs to be funneled through the marketing service catalogue.\n \nSandi Settle\n45:07\nGotcha. Yeah, okay.\nOn the next slide we wanted to show you. I believe it's the next slide. we wanted to show you\nsomething that we created using some of the initial data from the send 7 ebook process. We're still working on the ebook itself. But this is one example of what we can do with some of those data insights, and creating other pieces of contents that could extend the life of the campaigns, and this here is a infographic we'll provide the link to the sample right now. since Ivan has not seen this yet, either. So it's hot off the press. But this is\none exciting idea one way to visualize some of that data\nthat\nthat they provided as well.\nso our thought was to potentially, you know, turn this into a video or something as well. If the the client is interested, the prospect I have to jump off. But just 2 things. For example, one is, and we don't have to answer it on this call. One is that\n \nAnila Baseel\n46:15\nwe're trying to be out there in technology software? so how do we compete? And what are we not doing today that we could potentially look into right\nas next step for F 23. And the other is that I know Gina is amazing, and the teams really great. And you guys have been working amazingly. what else do you need from us? For me? From Gina, or anything that would make your lives a little bit easier other than content? what you know how. How else can we help you?\nbe more successful?\n \nSandi Settle\n46:48\nI think, understanding a little bit more about your overall goals for your you know your program itself and your slice of the business, I think, and understanding what you're trying to achieve for next year will help us.\nYou do do better.\ndo you have anything to add in here, Howard.\nunderstanding a little bit more about your lifetime goals, and how we measure success, you know, moving forward.\n \nHoward Sewell\n47:18\nYeah, I mean, it's always great to understand the larger goals and the grander objectives I would defer to you, Sandy, and the team being closer to the day to day than I am. But again it's it's a great\nrelationship, and one that is very collaborative, and a lot of information flowing back and forth. So\nyou know we are at this point. We are.\nyou know, and proving on\nthings that are\ngenerally working pretty well. So but we'll, you know we'll, we'll take that, you know. We'll take that request away and come back with ideas as well, so that's fair.\n \nGarrett Lawrence\n47:59\nGarrett. Did you have a question? No, i'm just gonna say, I mean, I agree anything as we learn about the specifics behind your goals and objectives that's really helpful, you know, if there's additional needs in terms of thought, leadership, and building your stature. If there's anything in customer, partner, advocacy you have, there's different things that we can contribute to. So happy to explore that and come back to you with some some thoughts.\n \nSandi Settle\n48:22\nThat's great. Thank you guys. I have to jump off, and this is really awesome. Thank you so much.\nGina Lexi. Do you have any questions?\n \nGina Madson\n48:34\nNo, i'm excited to see the ebook and the infographic, for some of them looks great, too, so that'll be great to have is the first one, and it sounds like march and edges back on track to move forward with theirs, too. So 2 of those up there to test in separate markets very different audiences. So right?\n \nSandi Settle\n48:52\nOkay, I think I have a last slide. Sorry, and this is just next steps.\nIf you could\nadvances side one more for me.\nI think next steps. Obviously, you know. Consider what's in here. We'll send you the Dac so we could develop a project plan, you know, moving forward. Some of the things we want to do is test some new vendors for the app marketplace campaign. we'd like to get approval\nan an understanding of what we're going to be moving forward with. We have a I think a straw man as to what kind of what our next\nquarter looks like, but maybe developing in the that plan out for Q. 4 2023, the April to June timeframe.\nwe will expedite the completion or we would like to expedite the completion of the ebook asset that your team is working on for content syndication.\nand we will share the infographic internally. And we're\nworking on the last touches for the ebook for cin 7 as well, and then potentially launching that partner survey or doing a workshop, whichever is best there. And if you discuss internally that you want to, you know, try out the Rev.\n \nHoward Sewell\n50:16\nOffer the insight, and i'm going to take an action item there, if I may, and that's too, because frankly, I don't know the answer to this is what makes them different, if at all, from in left.\nBecause I i'd i'd want to make sure that there's you know the differentiation and a value. Add there that would make even that exercise worthwhile. And so why Don't? Why, don't I find that out first, and then Gene and team we can. We can get back to you as to whether we still think that's maybe worth\nconsidering. So\n \nGina Madson\n50:52\nyeah, that'd be great. I'm curious to know myself. I'm sure there are some variations there, and\nI think a test would be fascinating. We just we've pulled back a little bit from our recruitment focus to emphasize more of our with partner marketing and activity. So I think that's maybe where there's a little hesitation to immediately jump in and test it. But yeah, and and again, just to be clear, I mean, this is just you know\n \nHoward Sewell\n51:17\nus running and running your customer list through their database, coming back with a few slides, and that's as far as it\nneeds to go. So it's basically just it's free data. But again, to the extent that you maybe are already getting all those insights.\nI just want to make sure it's worth even that amount of time, and that'll be on us to find out, and we'll get back to you.\n \nGina Madson\n51:37\nYeah, I mean, we do have a within. Let's not just quickly say, but we are still struggling to target effectively. We want to recruit into our program. So if there could be deeper levels of insight or takeaways or insight, you know, period information is generally helpful. So\n \nHoward Sewell\n51:55\nI I would love to test it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's great. Well, let me. Let me find out what the differences are, and then we can. We can. We can well work with Sandy and team, and we can talk about what the next steps might be.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n52:08\nSounds good.\n \nSandi Settle\n52:10\nWell, thanks, everybody, for the time we'll see you in a few minutes. I'm gonna take a quick break, and then we'll jump on the other. The other call.\n \nLynn Dodds\n52:18\nI don't think I am.\n \n\n\n Save & SubmitCancel"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Here is some text. Can you analyze claims about social problems in it?\n\nOur main story tonight concerns crime — y’know: McGruff’s kink. It’s genuinely impressive this crime dog taught a whole generation how to be narcs while simultaneously dressing like he’s about to jerk it in the back of a movie theater. Specifically, we’re going to talk about how crime is covered by the news. Because the news loves covering crime — sometimes seriously, and sometimes like this.\n\nLet’s get this straight from the start: you’re Nedra Brantley, right?\n\nI am.\n\nIs your name Mike?\n\nNo, it’s not.\n\nThis is what Nedra’s car looked like today. “Mike is a cheater” spray painted all over it. Cheater, cheater, Mike is a cheater. Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, see what you’ve done? I don’t know who you are. I don’t know where you are. But you may want to start changing your ways — or changing your name.\n\nJohn: Yes. I want that man on my tv all day every day. In fact, if you sent NBC4 Washington’s Pat Collins to Ukraine, I’d guarantee it’d be sorted out tomorrow. “Vlad Vlad Vlad Vlad Vlad — see what you’ve done?!” You’ve undoubtedly noticed that crime makes up a significant part of your local news’s programming. But the scale of that coverage has a real impact. Research has shown that viewing local tv news is related to increased fear of, and concern about crime, and that tv news viewers are also more likely to support tougher crime policies. Which does help explain why our perceptions of crime can be sharply at odds with the reality of it. For over thirty years, Gallup has asked Americans whether they think the U.S. has more or less crime compared to the year before, and in in every year but one, even as the actual crime rate has plummeted. Interestingly, the one year a majority said “less” was 2001. Famously a year where everything was super chill, no drama, just vibes. Tv news leans hard on “this could happen to you” crime stories, which are designed to pull you in — with the latest version being this.\n\nAuthorities continue to sound the alarm about the dangers of rainbow fentanyl.\n\nAnother warning about rainbow fentanyl — the deadly drug disguised as candy!\n\nIt is called rainbow fentanyl. The colorful candy-like appearance is actually designed to appeal to young kids.\n\nThey’re attractive, they’re colorful, they look like candy.\n\nThis is every parent’s worst nightmare. Especially in the month of October, as Halloween fast approaches. This is treacherous deception to market rainbow fentanyl like candy.\n\nJohn: Okay so, first, rainbow fentanyl sounds like the title of a very special episode of “My Little Pony.” But second, while the idea of it being made to target kids sounds scary, experts on narcotics have pointed out: those pills are almost certainly colored just to differentiate products, and it has nothing to do with marketing to kids at all, period, whatsoever. Which does makes sense, because kids — and this is true — not an ideal customer base for expensive street drugs. Because even if dealers were targeting trick-or-treaters with a “first one’s on the house” strategy, where do you expect little Zeke to come up with the cash for the next one? Sure, he’s got his weekly allowance, but he smacked his brother yesterday, so that’s that dollar gone. And the rest of his net worth is tied up in Lego store gift cards. He’s useless to dealers. Maybe check back in ten years when he gets prescribed oxy after a lacrosse injury. And look, that’s not to say that opioid addiction among young people isn’t a real issue — it obviously is. But it doesn’t help the conversation around that issue, to have newscasters jumping on splashy “your kid’s Halloween candy could be fentanyl” stories that even in this report, they half-acknowledge is bullshit, right at the very end.\n\nPolice departments are warning parents to check the candy their kids bring home from trick or treating.\n\nWe don’t want to have kids who are taking pills that they think is candy and is really not.\n\nThere have been no instances of that happening.\n\nJohn: Yeah, of course not. I’m so glad you tacked that disclaimer on at the end there. I’m sure the three second debunk read over the station logo is exactly what everyone’s going to take away from that report, and definitely not the images of little hulks sticking their hands into bowls of skittle-shaped smack. But that instinct to run an eye-catching crime story without being skeptical of its sourcing is unfortunately incredibly common. So given that, tonight, let’s talk about crime reporting — specifically, the incentives driving the outlets that cover crime, the flawed sources they rely upon, and the greater harm it can do to all of us. And let’s start with the obvious here — crime has always driven ratings. The mantra “if it bleeds, it leads” has been around for decades. But the philosophy really took hold around the 1970s, when two local stations in Philadelphia pioneered the “eyewitness” and “action news” formats, which leaned heavily on crime news. As one anchor there explained, “crime was cheap to cover. It was easy to cover. The assignment desk said to the cameraman, ‘you shoot the scene, you shoot the blood, you shoot victims, whatever they got. And you can do it in 20 seconds.'” But that isn’t good. The most meaningful stories are rarely the fastest or the cheapest. And I’m not just saying that because I host “very long news stories that are also expensive to produce: the comedy show,” I’m saying it because it’s true. Nonetheless, those formats quickly spread to 200 markets around the country. And by the 1990s, CNN even did a whole piece wondering if all that crime coverage was necessarily a good thing.\n\nCrime news can look a lot like entertainment.\n\nThe dark black is crime coverage.\n\nOne Los Angeles station, a study shows, spent over half its newscasts on crime. Others came close.\n\nI’m convinced that if you could get everyone who wanted to commit suicide to do it on — in a public place where the media could be present, we would have like a tv show called “suicide today.”\n\nJohn: Wow, way to bring down the room. But not to step on that man’s creative pursuits, but there’s already primetime programming where people kill themselves for our entertainment — it’s called Monday night football. Happy concussion season football fans! It sure feels like this sport maybe shouldn’t exist! So people have been raising the alarm about our obsession with crime news for a while. But it’s clearly been hard for news outlets to give it up. As they’re constantly making space for stories about crimes — be they major or incredibly minor — often illustrated with mugshots. The “New York Daily News” even has mugshot galleries on their website right now, with titles like, “criminally bad hair days.” And “babes behind bars.” It’s fun, isn’t it? It’s fun, because it’s their worst day. And the thing is, the faces that get shown can compound existing inequities in our justice system. A study a few years ago here in New York found that, while around a quarter of the city’s population is black, black people made up half of all arrests and three-quarters of criminals shown on the news. Which is clearly going to distort public perception. And while outlets may justify reporting on sensational arrests as “part of the public interest”, far too often — whether due to a lack of time, or resources, or inclination — they don’t follow up on what the outcomes of those cases are. Which can seriously impact people’s lives. Take Darcell Trotter — he and his brother were accused of sexual assault in 2012, by a woman who not only recanted her accusations, but pled guilty to filing a false police report. The problem is, their charges had already made the local news, which then never got around to mentioning the charges were dismissed. And years later, with uncorrected stories still sitting on news sites, Darcell was having to make calls like these.\n\nHow you doing, Jim? My name is Darcell Trotter and it was an article regarding of accused of — being accused of sexual assault, me, my twin brother.\n\nDid we do a story where the charges were dropped too?\n\nNo, you guys never did that.\n\nWe should’ve had a follow-up story that charges were dropped.\n\nYeah, I mean, that would have been nice.\n\nJohn: Yeah, it would’ve been! And if I could just talk to the “Jim” there for a second: hey Jim — I don’t know if that’s short for James, Jimothy, or Jimiroquai. But either way, Jim? Your paper goofed! You can’t just report the start of a story and ignore the end. Imagine if the news hadn’t covered the end of balloon boy. Oh, well! Guess he’s still up there! The balloon has left my immediate line of vision, so, who really gives a shit! So the news media can be overly reliant on eye-catching crime stories that are quick and easy to turn around. And the speed with which the daily crime beat operates actually leads to one of the biggest issues in crime coverage, which is that it often relies heavily on a single source. It’s why, if you watch tv news for any length of time, you’ll undoubtedly hear one particular phrase.\n\nThe Lovington police say they know who was responsible for a prank at a local park.\n\nPolice in Fairfield say an officer was attacked with bear spray.\n\nPolice say no suspects are in custody.\n\nPolice say —\n\nPolice say —\n\nPolice say —\n\nPolice say —\n\nPolice say —\n\nPolice say —\n\nJohn: Yeah, “police say” is a phrase you constantly hear from the mouths of news reporters. It’s right up there with, “this just in,” or “back to you,” or “I apologize for the accent I did on cinco de mayo.” And look, there’s obviously nothing wrong with calling the police to ask questions. When you’re working on a deadline, you can’t always reach arrested civilians or their attorneys, who sometimes don’t want to talk with you anyway. And police can be easy to reach — many larger departments have even set up robust media-relations divisions. The la county sheriff’s department has 42 people in its information bureau, at an annual cost of $4.8 million, and the LAPD spends over $3 million for 25 people in similar units. Which is already telling. Because while a certain amount of spending is necessary, you don’t spend that much on PR if things are going “great.” For context, all those budgets combined equal just one month’s salary for Ezra Miller’s publicist. They are so tired. They need to sleep. Even smaller police departments can have Public Information Officers, or PIO’s, and as this one proudly notes, his press releases can make it straight to air.\n\nSomething major happens, whether it’s a shooting or some major car accident, whatever it is. You go back to your office. You type up this long press release, and you send it out to the public and all the news agencies. Within minutes, you have reporters from all over the country calling you. There’s something strangely satisfying that when you put out that press release, hours later, you’re watching the news, and every station that’s talking about your story is literally reading your press release word for word.\n\nJohn: Set aside the fact that everything about this man answers the question “what if Fred Durst but worse?” That claim that the police’s versions of events can be parroted verbatim in the press is genuinely alarming. Although I can’t really fault him for being excited at seeing his work read word for word on tv. Ask my writers and they’ll tell you they experience the same thrill whenever I read one of their little jizz jokes. Their parents couldn’t be prouder. Hey, chrissy, did you like hearing me say your McGruff Dog jerking it joke, I bet you did you college graduate? But the fact reporters will echo PIO’s does explain certain things — like the ubiquity of phrases like “officer-involved shooting.” You see it in police accounts all the time, but it’s a weird term for reporters to repeat, because it deliberately omits crucial information about how the officer was involved. If you went to someone’s house for dinner and they said “tonight, there is a rat-involved dinner,” you’d justifiably have follow up questions. Are we going to a chuck e. Cheese? Is the chef being controlled by a tiny French rat under his hat? Or are we going to be on an episode of “kitchen nightmares?” All three are technically “rat-involved”, but some options are easier to live with than others. And honestly, police departments don’t always need a PIO to push their narrative, as outlets will sometimes just grab shit from a law-enforcement agency’s social media. For instance, police love posting evidence from busts they’ve conducted like this one, which a Texas news station not only shared on their own Facebook page, but even included on their evening broadcast.\n\nA search warrant executed Monday has left three people behind bars. The Tenaha police department has released information on the raid.\n\nAmong the items seized were two pounds of marijuana, illegally possessed prescription pills, drug paraphernalia, packaging materials, guns, and cash.\n\nJohn: Now, if you don’t really think about what you’re looking at there, I guess that seems like a story. But is it? Because, as many quickly pointed out, when you examine the photo, you realize, not only is that not a lot of drugs, there’s way less cash there than they’re going out of their way to make it look. Most of those are singles. That’s $70, total. One commenter on the station’s post said, “sick. This is Playskool’s my first dealer set,” with another adding, “who was the drug dealer, el cheapo?” And that speaks to the fact there can be a gap — sometimes small, but sometimes massive — between “the story police are telling everyone” and “the story that actually happened.” Because cops’ stories can, for a lot of reasons, turn out to be wrong, in ways both serious, and incredibly petty. Take the trend of cops claiming mistreatment at the hands of fast-food employees, which local news can be only happy to gobble right up.\n\nA possible hate crime against police is being investigated right now at a Shake Shack in downtown Manhattan. Sources tell CBS 2, three officers became sick after having shakes from the restaurant tonight. Police suspect an employee may have contaminated the drinks with bleach.\n\nThe Layton police sergeant ordered a sub and a lemonade from this Subway. But after taking a few sips of his drink, he quickly found out he got much more than what he paid for.\n\nHe was having a hard time maintaining his body. His body was jerking.\n\nWhat caused those side effects, police say, turned out to be a double dose of illegal narcotics.\n\nDJ, a local law enforcement officer told eyewitness news he suspects someone at McDonald’s took a bite from his sandwich before he completed the sale.\n\nTonight a McDonald’s in junction city is investigating after a police officer found insulting words written on his coffee. The F-word has been blurred out in this image of course but, you can see the word pig written right below it.\n\nJohn: Okay, there’s a lot there, but real quick: there was no bleach in the shakes, no drugs in the lemonade, the cop with the sandwich later admitted he’d simply forgotten he took a bite from it, and the one with the coffee admitted he’d written “fucking pig” on his own cup. Which is a serious act of self-loathing, unless you’re miss piggy, in which case it’s a slay. Outta the way boys, she’s got fashion to werk and frog dick to slurp. Who’s coffee is that? It’s this fucking pig’s. And that speaks to one of the major problems with deferring to police. Because — as many of you have undoubtedly been yelling at your tv, like I’m a wheel of fortune contestant who can’t solve the puzzle — police lie, and they lie a lot. As you’ve seen on this show, they’ve lied to get search warrants to conduct raids and to get confessions during interrogations, and they even lie under oath — so often that, here in New York, it came to be known as “testilying.” All of which should be more than enough for “the word of the police” to be treated with immense skepticism, rather than repeated verbatim. Take the notorious press release Minneapolis police put out following the murder of George Floyd titled “Man dies after medical incident during police interaction.” What you may not know is, it was picked up almost word for word by local news the next morning.\n\nWe do begin this morning with developing news. A man is dead after what police are calling a medical distress after being handcuffed. Now, officers were responding to a forgery in progress. It happened on the 3700 block of Chicago Avenue South. When they arrived, officers found a man they believed to be the suspect sitting inside a car. They apparently told him to get out. He resisted. Officers eventually got him handcuffed, which is when he appeared to have the medical issue. The suspect was taken to the hospital, where he died a short time later.\n\nJohn: Now, obviously, that’s a hugely self-serving statement from the police. Because by saying “George Floyd died because of medical distress,” their role was completely erased. His “medical distress” — and I’m using the biggest air quotes humanly possible — was the result of an officer pressing his knee into his neck for nine minutes. Repeating that claim by the police is an act of malpractice akin to Walter Cronkite saying, “JFK died of a headache today.” Sure, it’s not “technically” wrong, but it’s the understatement of the fucking century. The point is, it was only after the release of cell phone footage recorded by a brave seventeen year old girl, that that police narrative fell apart. Otherwise, that bullshit press release might well have been the version of events that everybody heard. And that’s not a one-off. An investigation last year of police killings in California, found at least a dozen examples of initial police statements misrepresenting events, with reports citing “vague medical emergencies without disclosing that officers had caused the emergencies through their use of force.” And “in most instances, media outlets repeated the police version of events with little skepticism.” Which isn’t good! There’s a time and a place for media outlets to operate without skepticism, and it’s the cover of health magazines — not an ounce of critical thinking on this extremely real cover that includes the headlines “Lose 9 waist inches in 21 days” and “News! A potato a day ups weight loss by 340%!” That’s rock solid science, presumably! And there are times where the trust reporters place in some police sources has been particularly egregious. Just take what happened in Chicago, after the police shot teenager Laquan McDonald sixteen times. In their initial coverage, multiple local outlets featured interviews with one person on the scene, whose version of events heavily favored the police.\n\nI don’t know what his mental state was, but he wasn’t dropping the knife and he was coming at the officer. You obviously aren’t going to sit down and have a cup of coffee with him. He is a very serious threat to the officers, and he leaves them no choice at that point but to defend themselves.\n\nJohn: Well, that’s a very detailed picture painted by palm beach potato head there, but a few things: first, while he sounds like an eyewitness, he wasn’t there. Second, videotape later revealed that the story he was telling was complete horseshit — police shot MacDonald when he was walking away from them. But finally, reporters should’ve known to take anything that guy said with a massive grain of salt, because Pat Camden is the spokesperson for the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, which functions as part police union, part special interest lobby group. His only agenda is to protect cops. And it was way too easy for this lil mustachio’d weirdo to hear there was a shooting, drive to the scene, jump in front of cameras and grab control of the narrative. And Camden does this a lot — one analysis found that in a four-year timespan, he provided an initial version of events for 35 police shootings. And in 15 cases, crucial aspects of his statements were later proved to be false or misleading. Which is just wild. If you get caught cheating at one casino, they ban you from every casino. This guy’s peddled bullshit to the press 15 times, yet somehow his picture isn’t pinned behind every news desk in the country, with the warning “do not ask this man about anything.” So, so, so often, it seems like news outlets would be serving their communities much better if they weren’t quite so trusting when it came to what police tell them. To see a lot of what I’ve talked about tonight in one place, take what happened in Brookside, Alabama, where a few years ago, local news was excitedly reporting on a new initiative from their police department, which “police said” was getting real results.\n\nWe tell you stories all the time about crime going up, but we got some good news: the town of Brookside says they’re seeing crime go down.\n\nBrookside is not a big town, but its narcotics interdiction team? They’ve been busy.\n\nAnother drug bust this weekend on i-22.\n\nAnd the Brookside police have been so busy.\n\nOur number one goal is to not prosecute people. It’s to save lives. That’s why we got into this. We want to save lives. We want to keep our citizens safe. We want to keep people who are coming to Brookside safe and enjoy our town.\n\nJohn: All that coverage is just so weird. It’s part local news fluff, part propaganda, and something bordering on a tourism ad from officer Teddy Ruxpin there. But think about it, it’s a bit strange that one tiny town in Alabama had suddenly become a hotbed for drug smuggling, right? Well, it turns out, yes. And I will say, to its credit, one local station did dig a little deeper, airing a report about the fact a weird amount of drivers were questioning the tickets written by that police department. A story, incidentally, that led that department to tell employees that anyone talking to that reporter would be fired. But it wasn’t until two years later that an in-depth investigation from al.com revealed what had actually been happening, that is that Brookside — a town of just 1,200 people — was having its finances rocket-fueled by tickets and aggressive policing, with bullshit traffic tickets being issued at a truly ridiculous rate.\n\nBrookside dragged so many people into court that police had to direct traffic on court days. Money from fines and forfeiture soared more than 600% to the point where it made up half the town budget.\n\nJohn: It’s true. It got to the point where the police department was taking in $487 for every man, woman and child, and spending it on, among other things, a swat team, a jail, a fleet of unmarked cars, and two drug-sniffing dogs — one of which they named, and this is true, k-9 cash. Here is that dog. And I will say, he does look like a k-9 cash. And that’s not a compliment. Bad dog. But the point is, what was actually happening in Brookside turned out to be a pretty far cry from the initial coverage of, “hey, great news, this small town police force is apparently Miami Vice all of a sudden. Anyway, no further questions.” And the thing is, by presenting police uncritically, you’re not just helping them dodge accountability — you’re giving them a huge lobbying platform. Right now, you don’t have to look far to find cops on tv, suggesting the fix for any rise in crime is to undo the criminal justice reforms of the past few years, and to give them more money. And this can get real results. Even the current rainbow fentanyl scare started with a DEA press release, which happened to drop just as congress was in the midst of budget negotiations. Everyone picked up that story, and what do you know, last week, Chuck Schumer announced his intention to allocate nearly 300 million more dollars to law enforcement, so they can fight the scourge of rainbow fentanyl. And look, I’m not saying all crime reporting is bad. There’s some incredible coverage out there. We feature it on this show all the time, and a lot of what I told you tonight, came from great investigative reporting. But the daily crime beat, whether from lack of resources, lack of scrutiny, or lack of follow-through, far too often, takes police at their word, and not as an interest group who should be treated as such. So, what should happen here? Well, the police could change the ways they both behave and communicate. But given that’s not going to happen anytime soon, it unfortunately falls to the rest of us. For news outlets, they could try and snap out of their automatic deference to police. Which is actually possible — just watch what happened when a political web series from the hill invited on a public defender to discuss the case of Jayland Walker, who was killed by police after fleeing a traffic stop. Watch her push back when the host seems a little too eager to accept the police line.\n\nThere’s no world, no traffic infraction, the punishment is death, not a one, never. So there’s no reason why eight officers should choose to go and shoot him to death.\n\nI — I guess I — I just don’t have a lot of sympathy in this particular case, although I do —\n\nYou don’t have a lot of sympathy in this case where he was shot 60 times?\n\nAfter fle — after leading the police on a high-speed chase and returning fire?\n\nFirst of all, let me just say this, the police, no, let’s — let’s — because too often media reports on what are police stories as though it is the ultimate truth. We see too many, too many discrepancies for us to cons — consistently lean on what the police say is the truth.\n\nAbsolutely, I agree.\n\nPolice say, which has not yet been substantiated or corroborated — they say they believe that one bullet might have come from the window. They said — that’s what the say. Their argument is maybe —\n\nRight, who knows if that’s true?\n\nExactly. But what I do know is that they shot this boy 60 times for a traffic infraction, I know that, so.\n\nAll right, we’ll have our rising panel join us next.\n\nJohn: That is amazing. If for nothing else than to watch baby Ryan Seacrest try to wrap up the segment after getting his ass absolutely handed to him. But while it’s incredible to watch him, in real time, backtrack from “I don’t have a lot of sympathy” to “absolutely, I agree, who knows what’s true?,” It shouldn’t be incumbent on that woman to walk him to that point. She can’t be on every local news set. She has a life to live. And there are small changes that might help reorient all of our thinking. Some experts have suggested that, rather than going with “police say,” outlets should consider going with “police claim,” instead which seems like a good start. And to be fair, some outlets are looking at other changes. Some, like the “USA Today” network, have stopped publishing mug shot galleries, saying they feed into negative stereotypes and are of limited news value. Which they are. And “The Arizona Republic” has pledged it will follow any case it covers to its conclusion, in courts or otherwise. Which hopefully will save people like Darcell Trotter from having to make phone calls like the incredibly restrained one that you saw him make earlier. But the larger cultural change might be for outlets to fundamentally reconsider whether the crimes they’re covering are actually newsworthy. Because the truth is, not all crimes are. And crime is only one small slice of the much bigger picture they could be painting of what’s happening in communities. The fact is, because crime news is pumped at us 24/7, the way it’s reported is deeply linked with how it’s both perceived by the public, and prosecuted by the state. And look, we’ve said before, local news is incredibly important, which is why it’s critical that it’s done well. So to the outlets who do put an undue amount of weight on police statements and prioritize sensational crime coverage over complete pictures of public safety, if I may, I’d like to throw it over to one of your own."}]}

The enforcers of “zero-covid” are nowhere to be found. In China’s battle against covid-19, the state has disappeared from the front lines. For nearly three years President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a “people’s war”. Now he has surrendered and the people must live with the enemy.\n\n\tListen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.\n\n\tMr Xi is not the first leader to conclude that such a fight was unwinnable. But before ditching their zero-covid policies, other countries first took pains to administer vaccines, stockpile antiviral drugs and draw up treatment guidelines. China had ample time to do all of that. Yet more than two years after the first vaccine proved effective, the country remains ill-prepared. That has made opening up much more dangerous than it ought to be.\n\n\tHow dangerous? In this week’s China section we publish our model of how the epidemic might play out. It comes with essential caveats. Modelling an epidemic is difficult. Modelling one in China, where the data are often unreliable, is even harder. We take into account variables such as vaccination rates, the effectiveness of Chinese jabs, the lethality of covid for different age groups and the number of intensive-care beds. In a worst case, if covid spreads freely and many people cannot get care, we estimate that in the coming months 1.5m Chinese people will die from the virus.\n\n\tAlthough that is a lower share of the population than in many rich countries, it is still a criticism of the government’s poor preparations. It is also a call to action. A vaccination drive will take months. The government has waited too long to build and staff new icus. But even if the state will not impose lockdowns while it prepares, it can mitigate the number of deaths.\n\n\tIt should start by protecting the health system. A wave of covid is breaking over China. Our model sees this peaking in January. By that time hospitals risk being overwhelmed. Beds and staff are a precious resource to be husbanded. That means keeping people who are not seriously ill away from hospitals. To that end, the state could help drug companies restock pharmacies that run out of such things as lateral-flow tests and paracetamol. Medical staff should be vaccinated first and they must be given the proper gear to minimise the risk of infection.\n\n\tA second step is to ensure cheap and plentiful supplies of covid drugs. Dexamethasone, a low-priced steroid, has been shown to reduce deaths among the most severely ill patients. Antivirals, such as Paxlovid, help keep those most at risk out of hospital. These drugs have become part of the toolkit doctors around the world are using to fight the virus. They could save many thousands of lives in China. Only the government knows if it has enough of them to go around. If not, it should start stocking up. Foreign governments would surely send supplies if China asked. President Xi Jinping should not let his pride imperil China’s people, as he has done by shunning more efficacious Western vaccines.\n\n\tChina’s vaccines still work. So the third priority is to get them into people’s arms. It may be too late for many in this wave, but there will be others. Less than half of those over 80 years old have had three shots, the number needed for decent protection against severe disease and death. Yet some of the elderly have gone to the clinic for a jab only to be turned away for lack of supplies. Until recently, some vaccine factories were sitting idle. Vast quantities will be needed. Six-monthly booster shots ought to become a normal part of life for older Chinese.\n\n\tAs the state has failed to do its job, people are helping themselves. Masks are ubiquitous in many cities and more people are working from home. Restaurants and cinemas may be open, but in cities such as Beijing they remain largely empty. All this will help slow the growth of this covid wave and ease the pressure on hospitals. But the government must also act. In a country the size of China, even small steps could save many lives.\"  \n\n\n\tFrom the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting:\n\n\n\t\t1. \"President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a “people’s war”\"\n\t\t2. \"A wave of covid is breaking over China. Our model sees this peaking in January.\"\n\t\t3. \"we estimate that in the coming months 1.5m Chinese people will die from the virus\"\n\t\t4. \"To that end, the state could help drug companies restock pharmacies that run out of such things as lateral-flow tests and paracetamol\"\n\t\t5. \"A second step is to ensure cheap and plentiful supplies of covid drugs.

So the third priority is to get them into people’s arms.\"\n\n\t  \nArticle:\n\n\t\"How Chinese people are dealing with the spread of covid-19\n\n\tThe government has left the public to fend for itself\n\n\tA elderly man wearing a face mask and goggle walks on a street in Beijing, Sunday, Dec. 11, 2022. Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, China is setting up more intensive care facilities and trying to strengthen hospitals as Beijing rolls back anti-virus controls that confined millions of people to their homes, crushed economic growth and set off protests.\n\n\tJust a few months ago Chinese people had little fear of catching covid-19. The government’s “zero-covid” measures kept them safe for the most part. Mass testing and strict lockdowns contained the virus. If a person did test positive, the government would swoop in. The infected were taken to state-run quarantine centres. If symptomatic, they were treated in a designated hospital. Health workers would douse their house with disinfectant and test their neighbours.\n\n\tAll this changed on December 7th, when the central government largely ditched its zero-covid policy, lifting most restrictions. Six days later it scrapped an app that tracked people’s movements. The highly transmissible Omicron variant had made zero-covid unsustainable.\n\n\tNow the public is expected to fend for itself. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” wrote the People’s Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece. Some residents of Beijing have received letters from the local committees that used to enforce covid controls. Stop reporting fevers and coughs to us, one read, before wishing people good luck. “Thank you for the past three years of support and understanding.”\n\n\tThe official number of new cases is falling, as if the virus were fading away. But official numbers are no longer reliable because the government has scaled back testing. If it has an alternative way of keeping tabs on the epidemic, it is not sharing it.\n\n\tStill, it is pretty clear that a covid wave is building, as people share stories of infection online. An informal survey has been circulating on social media asking Beijing residents if they have caught the virus. As The Economist went to press, 39% of the 434,000 or so respondents had said yes.\n\n\tSuch surveys are striking, not just for the numbers. A few months ago people who had caught covid were stigmatised. They might, for example, struggle to find jobs after recovering. Now the disease is so common that people are posting their test results on social media, often substituting for the word “positive” a cartoon of a sheep (which is a Chinese homophone for positive). Others are sharing lighthearted advice about the best time to catch covid. An infection now or in early January, for example, might clear up in time for a person to enjoy both Christmas and the lunar new year. “Why aren’t I positive yet?” complained one young woman in a video.\n\n\tOthers, though, are worried. Until recently the government told people that covid was to be feared. Now the official line is that Omicron is no worse than the flu. Infected people who are not showing serious symptoms have been encouraged to stay at home and treat themselves. Not everyone is listening. Beijing’s emergency-call operators have been swamped by over 30,000 calls a day, about six times the average. Queues have appeared outside fever clinics in several cities. Certain medicines are in short supply. On December 13th a health-care website began selling Paxlovid, a highly effective antiviral drug used to treat covid. Its initial stocks sold out in half an hour.\n\n\tHospitals are under more stress as doctors and nurses catch the virus. There are reports that some medical workers who have tested positive have been asked to come in anyway, risking more transmission within hospitals. As of December 13th Beijing had 50 severely ill patients, according to the official numbers. So far, the health system does not appear to be overwhelmed. But the peak of this wave is still some way off. It will probably come in late January, at least in Beijing, says Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong.\n\n\tWith the government changing its message, people are looking elsewhere for guidance. Overseas Chinese students who have experience with covid are sharing advice on WeChat, a social-media app. They tell people what symptoms to expect and how long they might last. In general, though, good information on the virus is lacking. There are reports of people going to hospital after taking too much fever medicine. Herbal remedies used to combat covid are in hot demand, though doctors doubt their effectiveness.\n\n\tVaccines, not voodoo\n\n\tAt least people now see the need to protect themselves against the virus, which was once viewed as a terrifying but distant threat. More are getting vaccinated. The number of jabs administered each day has increased from fewer than 200,000 to over 1m. But there is a lot of ground to make up, especially when it comes to the most vulnerable. Only around 40% of people over 80 have received the three doses needed to significantly reduce the chances of severe disease or death. Yet some elderly people have had trouble getting a shot because of a lack of supply at clinics.\n\n\tPeople are also taking steps that will help mitigate the spread of the disease and perhaps reduce the pressure on hospitals. In Beijing the shopping centres and streets are largely empty, as people stay inside. Call it a self-imposed lockdown. People who do venture out wear n95 masks (which are good at filtering small airborne particles). Demand for home deliveries of meals and groceries has shot up.\n\n\tBut people are still making plans to travel back to their villages and home towns for the lunar new year in late January. Data from Ctrip, a booking platform, show that the volume of searches for flights has increased by 160% since the government loosened restrictions. Searches for train tickets on Baidu, a search engine, increased by nearly 600% during that time. Many rural areas are woefully unprepared to handle a surge in cases.\n\n\tWhen the peak of this wave approaches, “it would make a lot of sense to bring back some public-health measures,” says Mr Cowling. But reversing course may be hard for the government to justify without admitting that it had made a mistake.\"\n\n\t  \nFrom the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting:\n\n\n\t\t1. \"lifting most restrictions.
