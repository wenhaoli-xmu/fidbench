{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "¿Puedes hacer un resumen de esta transcripción de un audio?\n\n56\n00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320\nAstro.\n\n57\n00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,720\nAstro es la nueva joya de la corona de desarrollo web.\n\n58\n00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,040\nBueno, al menos eso parece.\n\n59\n00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,560\nPorque Astro tiene una nueva versión estable 1.0\n\n60\n00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,160\ndesde agosto de 2022.\n\n61\n00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,160\nY sigue, sigue publicando nuevas versiones.\n\n62\n00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,600\nEn el momento de grabar esto, estamos en la 1.4.\n\n63\n00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,040\nAsí que sigue avanzando pasito a pasito.\n\n64\n00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,720\nAhora vamos a descubrir\n\n65\n00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840\nalgunas de sus principales características.\n\n66\n00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,920\nPero es gente muy lista,\n\n67\n00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,720\nes gente lista la que está detrás de este desarrollo,\n\n68\n00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,000\nporque su web ha ido evolucionando,\n\n69\n00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,840\na la vez que ha ido evolucionando también\n\n70\n00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,320\nlas capacidades que tiene de desarrollo.\n\n71\n00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320\nY ahora, si tú entras en la web,\n\n72\n00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,160\ntienes una captura que dice algo así como\n\n73\n00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,040\nRebuild my blog with Astro out of curiosity.\n\n74\n00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,280\nHolly...\n\n75\n00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,360\nSale como si fueran unas palabrotas, unos tacos.\n\n76\n00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,640\nO sea, alguien, bueno, en este caso el CEO de Pink Labs,\n\n77\n00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,880\nun tal Cio,\n\n78\n00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,800\nsaca una gráfica y dice\n\n79\n00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,640\nestoy reconstruyendo mi blog con Astro\n\n80\n00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,480\ny me ha llevado esta sorpresa.\n\n81\n00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,480\nEsto es una cosa espectacular.\n\n82\n00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,560\nUna expresión de júbilo,\n\n83\n00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,240\na la vez que de casi ofensa.\n\n84\n00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,880\nY es que antes estaba hecho con NETJS,\n\n85\n00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,520\nahora mismo el principal enemigo a batir\n\n86\n00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,720\nen este mundo de desarrollo web\n\n87\n00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,280\norientado hacia el Jamstack\n\n88\n00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,080\ny tiene 138 kilobytes de carga,\n\n89\n00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,880\nde carga de JavaScript.\n\n90\n00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,080\nY sale la comparativa con Astro y es un 7,6.\n\n91\n00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,920\nEs muy poquito en comparación.\n\n92\n00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600\nEs una diferencia muy grande.\n\n93\n00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,920\nY esa es una de las principales,\n\n94\n00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,040\nsi no la principal, característica de Astro\n\n95\n00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,840\ncon respecto a la competencia,\n\n96\n00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,720\na lo que había cuando empezaron a desarrollar Astro,\n\n97\n00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,240\nque es que quiere tener cero segment.\n\n98\n00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,320\nO sea, no quiere llevar al cliente, al navegador,\n\n99\n00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,160\nmás JavaScript del que sea estrictamente necesario.\n\n100\n00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960\nO sea, HTML, por favor.\n\n101\n00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,080\nQue el HTML es lo más rápido que se puede ejecutar en un navegador.\n\n102\n00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,360\nPone solo el JavaScript que necesite.\n\n103\n00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,560\nY además te invita,\n\n104\n00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,720\no vamos a ver cómo te invita\n\n105\n00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,600\no te permite tomar decisiones con respecto al JavaScript\n\n106\n00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,120\nque tú quieres que cargue.\n\n107\n00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,000\nO sea, te da mano en eso.\n\n108\n00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,480\nAhora tenemos ese detalle.\n\n109\n00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,640\nPero antes quiero pararme con algunos aspectos\n\n110\n00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,480\nque no son tan claros cuando tú entras en la web,\n\n111\n00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,000\npero para mí sí es bastante significativo.\n\n112\n00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,080\nY hay una diferencia fundamental con respecto a...\n\n113\n00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080\nYo diría que toda la competencia,\n\n114\n00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,440\ntoda, diría al 100% de la competencia,\n\n115\n00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,040\nun porcentaje muy pequeño de los entornos de desarrollo\n\n116\n00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,160\ntienen traducciones de la documentación al castellano.\n\n117\n00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,520\nY Astro sí que la tiene.\n\n118\n00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,920\nSí, hay algunos otros fringos que sí que tienen esa traducción,\n\n119\n00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,400\npero no es lo más habitual.\n\n120\n00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,480\nBueno, pues si te quieres sumergir en Astro en castellano,\n\n121\n00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,520\nes uno de los idiomas en los que su documentación,\n\n122\n00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,920\nno digo que está al completo,\n\n123\n00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,560\npero sí en un porcentaje no pequeño está traducida.\n\n124\n00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,360\nEstá traducida, así que es como un acercamiento mucho más liviano.\n\n125\n00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,720\nLos conceptos se pueden entender mejor.\n\n126\n00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,680\nY es que Astro quiere explicártelo bien.\n\n127\n00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,880\nA poco que profundices en la documentación,\n\n128\n00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,480\nte darás cuenta que dice, nosotros lo hacemos así.\n\n129\n00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,560\nSi lo quisieras hacer de esta otra forma,\n\n130\n00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,520\nsería más complicado. O no funciona,\n\n131\n00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,160\nporque nosotros hemos tomado esta decisión por ti.\n\n132\n00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280\nRecordar que Astro es un framework,\n\n133\n00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,360\npor tanto, toman decisiones por ti,\n\n134\n00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,280\notra cosa es que a ti te gusten o no.\n\n135\n00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,720\nY hay otro aspecto que también está en el menú,\n\n136\n00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,880\nque es la plantilla.\n\n137\n00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,680\nTiene un repositorio, a lo mejor no es muy grande,\n\n138\n00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,120\nsobre todo si viene desde el mundo de WordPress,\n\n139\n00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,440\nque es muy pequeño,\n\n140\n00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,600\no incluso de Wix o de Squarespace o de cualquier otro de estos lugares,\n\n141\n00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,760\npero en comparación con la competencia,\n\n142\n00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,400\ntambién está mejor planteado, en el sentido de que se vea a la primera,\n\n143\n00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,800\nque hay plantillas disponibles para que todo sea más llevadero.\n\n144\n00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,080\nAl final, y esto es una reflexión no solamente para Astro,\n\n145\n00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,760\nsino para todo tipo de desarrollo,\n\n146\n00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,240\nsi estás implicado en un desarrollo que quieres que la gente lo utilice,\n\n147\n00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,760\ntienes que tomar buena nota de esto, hay que hacer labor de marketing,\n\n148\n00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,840\nhay que presentar las cosas bonitas y, sobre todo, sencillas.\n\n149\n00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,160\nEntonces, si alguien quiere probar Astro, como hacía este tal Cio,\n\n150\n00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,400\nque estaba tan asombrado,\n\n151\n00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,160\nnecesitamos tener recursos que hagan que eso sea más fácil,\n\n152\n00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,760\ny una de esas cosas que invitan es tener varias plantillas para elegir,\n\n153\n00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,560\naunque luego no utilicemos ninguna,\n\n154\n00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,240\no aunque luego digamos, bueno, todo lo programa un mono.\n\n155\n00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,320\nPrefiero hacerlo yo.\n\n156\n00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,880\nMono con platillos, me refiero.\n\n157\n00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,080\nNo me gusta cómo está hecho esto, pero lo quiero hacer a mi manera.\n\n158\n00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,840\nPero la puerta de entrada se hace mucho más amplia.\n\n159\n00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,040\nAstro tiene soporte nativo para Markdown, antes de que me preguntéis.\n\n160\n00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,120\nO sea, ya directamente entiende este formato\n\n161\n00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,680\ny también entiende el formato MDX.\n\n162\n00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,880\nY, bueno, como veremos ahora, tiene algunas características más.\n\n163\n00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,960\nSí quiero detenerme en otro aspecto,\n\n164\n00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,200\ntampoco está reflejado aquí directamente en la página principal\n\n165\n00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,880\nde Astro.Build,\n\n166\n00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,760\nque si trabajáis con Visual Studio Code,\n\n167\n00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,640\nque entiendo que de alguna forma\n\n168\n00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,400\nprácticamente todo el mundo trabaja con esto, o con WebStorm,\n\n169\n00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,480\nsabemos que hay más, hay más ideas en el mercado,\n\n170\n00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,560\npero parece que Visual Studio Code es ahora, que marca bastante la pauta,\n\n171\n00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,080\nque sepáis que hay una extensión de Astro para Visual Studio Code\n\n172\n00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,360\nque facilita el trabajo con él.\n\n173\n00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,160\nBásicamente porque Astro propone su propia extensión,\n\n174\n00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,480\nvais a quedar flipados con el nombre de la extensión de fichero\n\n175\n00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,480\nque han propuesto, es.Astro.\n\n176\n00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,600\nY, bueno, pues nos va a permitir\n\n177\n00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,880\nque Visual Studio Code o cualquier otro editor,\n\n178\n00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,320\nsi tiene extensiones, lo he mirado, pero es probable que sí que los tenga,\n\n179\n00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,400\nporque al final quieren que más gente lo use.\n\n180\n00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,280\nBueno, pues que entienda esta extensión y entienda,\n\n181\n00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,720\ncomprenda cómo están construidos estos ficheros y para lo que sirven.\n\n182\n00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,680\nSi te adelanto, porque puede que te estalle un poco la cabeza,\n\n183\n00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,960\nque Astro lo que ha querido en esos ficheros\n\n184\n00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,800\nes recoger un poco la experiencia que se va teniendo con el mundo del Jamstack,\n\n185\n00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,680\ndonde claramente hay dos...\n\n186\n00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,280\nTodos los desarrollos se dividen en dos cosas.\n\n187\n00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,040\nUna es lo que ve el usuario, o sea, lo que...\n\n188\n00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,720\no lo que se va a convertir luego en el HTML estático,\n\n189\n00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,000\ny la otra es todo lo que necesitas, en este caso de JavaScript,\n\n190\n00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,560\npero en Hugo, por ejemplo, sería con Go, ¿no?\n\n191\n00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,160\nDependiendo del lenguaje de programación, en este estamos con JavaScript.\n\n192\n00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,360\nTodo lo que vas a necesitar de JavaScript para que se puedan presentar los datos.\n\n193\n00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,600\nEntonces, es como una división de markdown.\n\n194\n00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,160\nNo sé si habéis visto alguna vez el front matter.\n\n195\n00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,880\nFront matter es esa forma que implantó Jekyll, si no me equivoco,\n\n196\n00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,600\npara poder poner en la cabecera de un fichero markdown metadatos.\n\n197\n00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,680\nEntonces, pones unas líneas, unos guiones, arriba y abajo,\n\n198\n00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,880\ny eso es como que los editores de markdown todos entienden\n\n199\n00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,280\nque ahí hay como una especie de metadatos donde tienes clave valor.\n\n200\n00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400\nEn el caso de Astro, es con vitaminas,\n\n201\n00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,840\ny además puedes poner ahí código JavaScript.\n\n202\n00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960\nAsí de claro.\n\n203\n00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,120\nPor ejemplo, tengo uno aquí delante.\n\n204\n00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,440\nLet allPost igual a await Astro,\n\n205\n00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,240\nes la librería global, punto, glob,\n\n206\n00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,000\ny entonces hace una captura, o intenta hacer una captura\n\n207\n00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,880\nde todos los ficheros markdown de la carpeta post.\n\n208\n00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,680\nPara luego tener este allPost disponible en el resto del fichero.\n\n209\n00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800\nAsí, así te lo cuento.\n\n210\n00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,040\nYa habrá tiempo de profundizar,\n\n211\n00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,200\nte invito a hacerlo, nosotros lo vamos a hacer en el taller,\n\n212\n00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,840\npero al final van acoplando esas necesidades que se van viendo\n\n213\n00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,480\ny que en otros sistemas similares o que intentan llegar al mismo sitio,\n\n214\n00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,680\nsí se nota que, bueno, pues al final tú te tienes que buscar la vida,\n\n215\n00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,640\npor ejemplo, para que leas los ficheros markdown.\n\n216\n00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,280\nO esa combinación entre JavaScript, markdown, MDX,\n\n217\n00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,960\nque parece ya muy simple al principio,\n\n218\n00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,080\npues al final tiene una carga de código que tienes que generar tú,\n\n219\n00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,880\nque sí, lo puedes copiar y pegar de cualquier tutorial.\n\n220\n00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,200\nPero bueno, si al final lo que quieres es montar un blog,\n\n221\n00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,800\npues ¿por qué no te ahorran ese proceso?\n\n222\n00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920\nEs lo que piensa uno, ¿no?\n\n223\n00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,160\nDice, está muy bien, me aprendes, genial, estupendo,\n\n224\n00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,960\npero yo lo que quiero es ir al rano,\n\n225\n00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,640\nquiero aquí ver cómo funcionan los enlaces,\n\n226\n00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,360\nver cómo el rendimiento de la web al final.\n\n227\n00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,960\nAsí que, bueno, estas son algunas de las cosas que me parecen llamativas\n\n228\n00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,240\nantes de entrar a la chicha, al mogollón.\n\n229\n00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,240\nEn la web de Astro aparece enseguida\n\n230\n00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,880\ncuáles son las características principales que tiene.\n\n231\n00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,520\nEnfocado al contenido, esto es lo que acabo de decir,\n\n232\n00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,200\nAstro fue diseñado para sitios web ricos en contenido,\n\n233\n00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,520\npara que eso sea muy fácil de capturar.\n\n234\n00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,200\nEl servidor, lo primero.\n\n235\n00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,080\nLos sitios se ejecutan más rápido si no tienen JavaScript.\n\n236\n00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,320\nO sea, si partimos de un HTML más básico.\n\n237\n00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,720\nSi el HTML ya está en el servidor generado.\n\n238\n00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,840\nRápido, por defecto, dicen,\n\n239\n00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,040\nes imposible crear un sitio web lento con Astro.\n\n240\n00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,440\nBueno, déjalo en manos, déjalo en nuestras manos.\n\n241\n00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240\nVerás cómo somos capaces.\n\n242\n00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,120\nFácil de usar.\n\n243\n00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,240\nEllos dicen que no hace falta ser experto para desarrollar algo en Astro,\n\n244\n00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,240\nes verdad que es bastante limpio, pero bueno,\n\n245\n00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,240\nsi realmente no has nunca aterrizado\n\n246\n00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240\npor el mundo del desarrollo web\n\n247\n00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,120\nen el contexto del mundo del Jamstack,\n\n248\n00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,240\npues algunos conceptos son intercambiables con otros frameworks,\n\n249\n00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360\npero hay que saber cuáles son.\n\n250\n00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,120\nY bueno, pues tiene más de 100 integraciones,\n\n251\n00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,320\nluego hablaremos un poco más sobre ellas.\n\n252\n00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,760\nAstro se basa en un tipo de arquitectura\n\n253\n00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,560\nque se llama Islands Architecture, o sea, la arquitectura de las islas,\n\n254\n00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,280\ny se han apropiado de ella, y aquí es donde viene,\n\n255\n00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,520\npara mí, el hecho que pueda hacer que esta herramienta\n\n256\n00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,040\nsea la joya de la corona, y hemos llegado a ese punto, ¿no?\n\n257\n00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,520\nPorque lo que hace es que esas islas aisladas\n\n258\n00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,760\ny que forman parte de nuestra arquitectura sean componentes.\n\n259\n00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,720\nEntonces, en vez de tener una web,\n\n260\n00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,360\nuna single-page application, por ejemplo,\n\n261\n00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,800\no bueno, una aplicación de otro tipo,\n\n262\n00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920\npero para que nos hagamos una idea, una SPA,\n\n263\n00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,720\ndonde todo va incrustado dentro de esa aplicación,\n\n264\n00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,120\npues lo que quiere, o lo que propone Astro,\n\n265\n00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,520\nes que cada pieza, cada uno de esos componentes\n\n266\n00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,120\nesté generado por JavaScript de forma independiente.\n\n267\n00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,240\nO sea, en vez de tener un bundle con toda la aplicación, no.\n\n268\n00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,920\nTú dices, pues mira, yo aquí quiero poner un formulario,\n\n269\n00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,200\nyo aquí quiero poner un contador,\n\n270\n00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,400\nyo aquí, o sea, darle al botón, incrementar y incrementar,\n\n271\n00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,040\nyo quiero aquí poner aquí un slider que hace algo específico,\n\n272\n00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,840\no otro bloque que sea un tracker\n\n273\n00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,160\nde las últimas cotizaciones del blockchain,\n\n274\n00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,600\nme lo invento, ¿no?\n\n275\n00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,240\nY que cada uno se comporte de forma diferente.\n\n276\n00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,520\nO sea, como que estás creando pequeñas aplicaciones\n\n277\n00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,040\nque luego vas a incrustar en ese punto Astro,\n\n278\n00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,920\nen ese fichero global donde vas a meter esas piezas\n\n279\n00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,760\nen el sitio adecuado, porque Astro te va a permitir,\n\n280\n00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,920\ncomo os decía antes, en esa parte primera de ese fichero\n\n281\n00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,040\nte va a permitir cargarlo, te va a permitir cargarlo.\n\n282\n00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,360\nY esta es la maravilla que hace que Astro sea compatible\n\n283\n00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,520\ncon React, con Vue, con Preact, con LIT,\n\n284\n00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,800\ncon AlpineJS, con Solid y con Svelte.\n\n285\n00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,200\nCreo que no me he dejado ninguna, las tenía por aquí delante.\n\n286\n00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,200\nO sea, es compatible con varios frameworks,\n\n287\n00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,880\nporque, claro, cada una se hace, cada aplicación se hace por su cuenta.\n\n288\n00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,200\nImaginados si trabajáis en un equipo grande\n\n289\n00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,920\ny cada parte del equipo, o son muchas personas,\n\n290\n00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,000\no lo tenéis de forma muy distribuida,\n\n291\n00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,080\ny cada parte del equipo se experta en algo diferente.\n\n292\n00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,840\nEvidentemente existen otras formas de orquestar esto,\n\n293\n00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,160\npero la que propone Astro es decir,\n\n294\n00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,760\nbueno, pues hay un equipo, hay unas gentes que lo hacen en React,\n\n295\n00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,080\notras lo hacen en Vue, otras lo hacen en Svelte,\n\n296\n00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,360\nnosotros lo que podemos hacer es algo que aglutine eso.\n\n297\n00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,720\nEvidentemente, evidentemente,\n\n298\n00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840\nesto hará que sea la aplicación más grande,\n\n299\n00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,800\nquizás innecesariamente grande,\n\n300\n00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,880\npero puede que también estés en un caso como podría estar yo,\n\n301\n00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,280\nque es, bueno, tienes hecho un desarrollo\n\n302\n00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,920\ncon lo que ya conoces, con Vue, con React, con lo que te guste,\n\n303\n00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,120\npero hay algo que te viene hecho\n\n304\n00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,240\no que tú puedes insertar directamente en tu web\n\n305\n00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,080\ny te hace mucha ilusión, que sea, por ejemplo, una pizarra en blanco,\n\n306\n00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,480\ny has encontrado un script maravilloso\n\n307\n00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,960\nque alguien ha desarrollado, ha puesto en Open Source\n\n308\n00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,920\ny lo quieres incorporar ahí, pero tu web está hecha entera en Vue\n\n309\n00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,200\ny eso está hecho en React.\n\n310\n00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,160\nEn el mundo que conocíamos hasta ahora,\n\n311\n00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,760\nera más difícil hacer que estas piezas encajaran,\n\n312\n00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,920\nevidentemente ya se podía.\n\n313\n00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,840\nAstro no ha venido a decirnos aquí\n\n314\n00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,840\ncomo que esto era imposible,\n\n315\n00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,120\npero nos da las piezas para que sea mucho más sencillo.\n\n316\n00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,760\nO sea, que esa parte conviene de tenerla en cuenta,\n\n317\n00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,960\npero es independiente.\n\n318\n00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,280\nEs independiente de si tú quieres\n\n319\n00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,440\nque complicate tanto la vida o es por una cuestión de necesidad.\n\n320\n00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,960\nAsí que quedémonos con eso.\n\n321\n00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,640\nCada componente es una mini aplicación independiente\n\n322\n00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,320\ny Astro se va a encargar de orquestar todo eso\n\n323\n00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,960\npara que al final el usuario lo vea en pantalla.\n\n324\n00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,920\nPero esto tiene una segunda parte.\n\n325\n00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,320\nEsto tiene una segunda parte.\n\n326\n00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,440\nHay algo que sí conviene reseñar,\n\n327\n00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,080\nporque esto es muy propio del Jamstack\n\n328\n00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,880\ny seguro que si ya tienes experiencia te lo estarás preguntando,\n\n329\n00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,440\nque es el Server Side Rendering.\n\n330\n00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,920\nO sea, ese renderizado de HTML\n\n331\n00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,680\nque se hace del lado del servidor\n\n332\n00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,440\no que se hace, por ejemplo, en tu local\n\n333\n00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,800\ncuando ejecutas una build\n\n334\n00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,440\ny ejecutas una HTML de salida,\n\n335\n00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,720\nAstro está preparado para esto.\n\n336\n00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,240\nPero también tiene una serie de adaptadores\n\n337\n00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,560\npara que lo que tú generes se pueda renderizar\n\n338\n00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,600\ncon Node.js, con Deno, con Vercel, con Netlify.\n\n339\n00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,160\nY es curioso cómo hace esa forma de abstraerse,\n\n340\n00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,000\nde hacerse agnóstico incluso a los sistemas\n\n341\n00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,400\nque son los que generan ese HTML en el servidor.\n\n342\n00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,240\nAsí que a mí me parece muy significativo.\n\n343\n00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,880\nDe hecho, creo que un poco explorado incluso por mi parte\n\n344\n00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,440\nesas capacidades y el hecho de entender\n\n345\n00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,640\nque, por ejemplo, Node.js está casado con Vercel,\n\n346\n00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,440\naunque tú lo puedas desplegar en otros sitios,\n\n347\n00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,760\npero ellos quieren que esto sea agnóstico.\n\n348\n00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,280\nComo por delante, o sea, la parte del frontend,\n\n349\n00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,880\ntanto como por detrás,\n\n350\n00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,800\nsi pensamos que el backend está en la parte de atrás,\n\n351\n00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,080\ncon la parte del desarrollo y la evolución.\n\n352\n00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,560\nPero aquí aterrizamos, todo esto,\n\n353\n00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,840\nlo quería explicar porque aquí aterrizamos\n\n354\n00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,080\nen la parte donde tú tomas la palabra.\n\n355\n00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,400\nY llegamos a la progressive hydration,\n\n356\n00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,440\nla hidratación progresiva,\n\n357\n00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,760\nsi quieres entenderlo con una traducción al castellano.\n\n358\n00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,040\nAquí es donde la magia de Astro se une\n\n359\n00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,240\ny donde entran en la combinación las partes que os he explicado antes,\n\n360\n00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,040\ntanto la arquitectura de islas\n\n361\n00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,160\ncomo los componentes renderizados en el servidor.\n\n362\n00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,960\nComo hemos quedado,\n\n363\n00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,760\ntu página está dividida en unas aplicaciones,\n\n364\n00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,200\nmini aplicaciones,\n\n365\n00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,880\ncada componente puede ser una mini aplicación hecha\n\n366\n00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,160\nen su propio JavaScript, incluso en Vanilla, evidentemente,\n\n367\n00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,720\ny además, generadas en el servidor,\n\n368\n00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,720\nSSSR que hemos visto.\n\n369\n00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,600\nEntonces, nos queda decir, bueno, ya, pero yo, por ejemplo,\n\n370\n00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,880\nquiero que la gente pueda interactuar,\n\n371\n00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,800\n¿de qué me vale tener un botón para incrementar y decrementar un contador\n\n372\n00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,040\nsi no funciona?\n\n373\n00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,680\nPorque de momento no hemos hablado de desplegar JavaScript.\n\n374\n00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,560\nBueno, pues es aquí donde tú puedes tomar la decisión\n\n375\n00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,640\ny decir que un componente tiene unos atributos especiales\n\n376\n00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,200\ncuando estás trabajando en Astro,\n\n377\n00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,160\nese componente se despliegue en clientes de la forma normal\n\n378\n00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,040\ncomo se han desplegado en el JavaScript siempre,\n\n379\n00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,160\nque es toda esa funcional JavaScript que se cargue cuando se carga la HTML\n\n380\n00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,040\npara que pueda manipular el DOM\n\n381\n00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,560\ny cuando tú aprietas ese botón de incrementar o decrementar,\n\n382\n00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,600\nel numerito vaya cambiando.\n\n383\n00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,840\nPero ellos han ido más allá y, por ejemplo,\n\n384\n00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,880\notra de las cosas que puedes hacer es que tú tienes un formulario\n\n385\n00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200\nen el pie de la página.\n\n386\n00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,640\nEse formulario puede tener un JavaScript asociado\n\n387\n00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,840\npara que cuando el usuario meta su correo electrónico,\n\n388\n00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,040\nreciba un mensaje de confirmación y haga una redirección\n\n389\n00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,160\no le apunte a otro sitio, salga un pop-up o confetti.\n\n390\n00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,320\nBueno, ahí hay una carga de JavaScript, eso es evidente.\n\n391\n00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,240\n¿Por qué no cargar eso solo cuando el usuario llegue a esa parte\n\n392\n00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,920\ny no desplegar más JavaScript del necesario?\n\n393\n00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,800\nBueno, pues hay otra forma, otro pequeño atributo,\n\n394\n00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,520\nIDLE se llama, donde tú cargas el...\n\n395\n00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,720\nBueno, he dicho que se llama IDLE,\n\n396\n00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,320\npero a lo mejor no s�� si estoy hablando de memoria\n\n397\n00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,240\ny ahora mismo no lo tengo delante.\n\n398\n00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,600\nEse componente es el JavaScript que despliega ese componente\n\n399\n00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,000\npara que esa funcionalidad esté disponible\n\n400\n00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,800\ncuando el usuario hace algo con ese formulario en HTML.\n\n401\n00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,440\nBueno, pues se cargue solo cuando el usuario llegue ahí,\n\n402\n00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,960\ncuando haya hecho el scroll y llegue a esa parte.\n\n403\n00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,680\nAsí que toda esa carga de JavaScript\n\n404\n00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,600\nsolamente le va a aterrizar al usuario cuando llegue ahí.\n\n405\n00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,960\nMe imagino que utilizará el Intersection Observer\n\n406\n00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,880\npara poder hacer esa combinación.\n\n407\n00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,280\nEsto, sin duda, a mí es algo que me parece esencial\n\n408\n00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,960\npara que tenga un nivel de competencia con respecto a otros sistemas.\n\n409\n00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,560\nMás allá de la complejidad que podemos buscarnos\n\n410\n00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,000\ny nos metemos en decir,\n\n411\n00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,960\npues este componente lo hago en esta librería,\n\n412\n00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,160\nesto es Vanilla, esto es React, esto es Nervell.\n\n413\n00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,280\nMás allá de eso, también utilizarlo de forma inteligente.\n\n414\n00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,240\nEl HTML sigue siendo HTML.\n\n415\n00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,760\nLe damos propiedades dinámicas allá donde nos conviene\n\n416\n00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,320\ny además lo podemos desplegar según quiera.\n\n417\n00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,280\nUna de las cosas que también podéis ver en la documentación\n\n418\n00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,840\nes que tiene varios componentes,\n\n419\n00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,480\nya lo he ido explicando, varias integraciones,\n\n420\n00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,600\ntanto con los frameworks de UI como los adaptadores de SSR,\n\n421\n00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,640\npero también tienes un módulo hecho en casa,\n\n422\n00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,400\nun componente, una extensión para trabajar con imágenes,\n\n423\n00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,960\npara trabajar con MDX,\n\n424\n00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080\npara tener también acceso a Tailwind,\n\n425\n00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,680\npara generar un sitemap y un montón de cosas.\n\n426\n00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,080\nPero más de uno, quizás ya los que estéis más en modo hardcore\n\n427\n00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200\ncon todo esto del desarrollo,\n\n428\n00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320\nestaréis pensando, ¿vale? Muy bien.\n\n429\n00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,560\nDani, me has contado esto de que son mini aplicaciones,\n\n430\n00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,680\nque son islas, claro, pero las islas entre sí no se comunican, ¿no?\n\n431\n00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,280\n¿Cómo podemos hacer que las islas tengan una comunicación entre ellas?\n\n432\n00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,680\nBien, Astro resuelve esto echando balones fuera\n\n433\n00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,440\ny diciendo que en este contexto\n\n434\n00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,560\npodemos comunicar unos componentes con otros\n\n435\n00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,000\nutilizando una librería de terceros que se llama NanoStore.\n\n436\n00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,960\nEs una librería agnóstica,\n\n437\n00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,680\ntambién no se casa con ningún framework\n\n438\n00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,200\ny nos va a permitir combinar la información\n\n439\n00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,600\nde unos componentes y otros para que sepan en qué estado está.\n\n440\n00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,480\nLa verdad es que en JavaScript, según han ido pasando los años,\n\n441\n00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,200\nme he dado cuenta que el punto clave de todo es controlar el estado.\n\n442\n00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,040\nTener la fuente única de verdad para que nos diga\n\n443\n00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,040\nsi el usuario tiene abierto el pop-up o cerrado,\n\n444\n00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,240\no si ha pulsado el botón o no lo ha cerrado.\n\n445\n00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,760\nEstas cosas, cuando es un pequeño tutorial,\n\n446\n00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,720\nuna pequeña guía está muy bien, pero cuando tenemos cientos de cosas\n\n447\n00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,120\nque controlar, que no es broma,\n\n448\n00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,880\nque enseguida llegan las cientos de cosas a controlar,\n\n449\n00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000\npues ¿por qué no poder hacer un control exhaustivo de ese estado\n\n450\n00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,120\ny saber siempre cómo se va a mostrar al usuario\n\n451\n00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,360\nel siguiente paso, el paso en el que está?\n\n452\n00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,160\nAsí que estas NanoStore, que están recomendadas en esta librería,\n\n453\n00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,840\nque la verdad es que tienen muy buena pinta,\n\n454\n00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,760\nes muy pequeñita, menos de un kilobyte,\n\n455\n00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,000\nno tiene dependencias y es la que te recomienda Astro\n\n456\n00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,600\npara que trabajes el estado combinado entre componentes.\n\n457\n00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,520\nPara acabar, bueno, puede ser este Astro un competidor real\n\n458\n00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,760\ndel que ahora aparece todo poderoso e inexpugnable en NES-JS.\n\n459\n00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,680\nYo creo que sí, aunque evidentemente los que están habituados\n\n460\n00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,280\nen desarrollar en React, que es un montón de gente,\n\n461\n00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,440\ny la popularidad que tiene NES-JS es difícil de desbancar.\n\n462\n00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,840\nAl final, en el mundo del software siempre aparece el mismo modelo.\n\n463\n00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,760\nAparece un modelo de una compañía o de un equipo\n\n464\n00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,400\nque desarrolla un framework, una librería,\n\n465\n00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,840\nque hace que todo sea muy fácil, pero que te tengas que casar de alguna forma\n\n466\n00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,240\ncon algunas convenciones que hacen, que puede que te gusten o no,\n\n467\n00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,640\nen el caso de NES-JS, utilizar React y estar favorecido\n\n468\n00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,440\nel hecho de utilizar Vercel, que es la compañía que está detrás,\n\n469\n00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,960\npara hacer esos despliegues en su infraestructura.\n\n470\n00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,400\nY luego está el otro modelo, que es el modelo libre,\n\n471\n00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,200\nel que no se quiere casar con nadie, el que quiere pensar en ti,\n\n472\n00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,560\nen el developer, para que hagas las cosas que tú quieres hacer,\n\n473\n00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,400\ntomes tus decisiones, pero luego tú te encargas,\n\n474\n00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,200\ncomo si quieres hacer un adaptador propio y desplegarlo,\n\n475\n00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,600\nque sería un PHP, no sé si alguien tiene esa idea en la cabeza.\n\n476\n00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,920\nEntonces, Astro camina por esa parte,\n\n477\n00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,640\ncon lo cual es una competencia directa, aunque habrá que ver cómo evoluciona.\n\n478\n00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,320\nDesde luego, el hecho de que Astro siga sacando nuevas versiones,\n\n479\n00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,520\nconsigue rondas de financiación,\n\n480\n00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,640\ny en el fondo sigue teniendo una actividad grande,\n\n481\n00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,480\nhará que crezca su comunidad, que crezcan los casos de uso,\n\n482\n00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,080\ndonde se ha utilizado Astro para desarrollar aplicaciones\n\n483\n00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,560\ncada vez más complejas, y yo creo que va a ir encontrando su hueco.\n\n484\n00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,520\nVa a ir encontrando su hueco porque irá escuchando las necesidades\n\n485\n00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,280\ny tendrá ventaja con respecto a sus competidores,\n\n486\n00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,400\nno solamente en el JS, por el hecho de que apareció después.\n\n487\n00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,560\nY como todos los frameworks y todas las librerías y todo el software\n\n488\n00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,720\nque aparece después, juega con las cartas un poco más marcadas,\n\n489\n00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,960\nporque sí sabe por dónde empezar, porque conoce mejor las necesidades\n\n490\n00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,680\nde los que nosotros queremos tener.\n\n491\n00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,640\nAsí que nada, te invito a probar Astro.\n\n492\n00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,320\nSi eres suscriptor de web activa, podrás también acceder a ese taller,\n\n493\n00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:19,080\ny espero que te guste y que te animes a probarlo.\n\n494\n00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,680\nLo decía al principio, toda apuesta tecnológica por un producto de software\n\n495\n00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,560\nque tiene muy poco tiempo de evolución, tiene más riesgo que cuando\n\n496\n00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,480\napuestas por algo que lleva años y años de evolutivo,\n\n497\n00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,600\ndonde ya se han resuelto un montón de circunstancias y errores posibles.\n\n498\n00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,760\nEs evidente que eso está ahí, pero también es cierto que se abren puertas\n\n499\n00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,080\nque uno a lo mejor no espera, y desarrollos que parecían que podían quedarse\n\n500\n00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,120\nen una versión 0.03 alfa toda una vida, como ha pasado en muchas ocasiones\n\n501\n00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,000\ny aún así nos hemos atrevido a utilizar en producción, pues llegan a la versión 1.0,\n\n502\n00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,640\n1.4, creo que estaba ahora, como Astro, y te van presentando\n\n503\n00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,560\ny te van poniendo el caramelito de delante para que juegues con él,\n\n504\n00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,640\ny en función de eso decidas si lo quieres utilizar o no.\n\n505\n00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,200\nPuede ser una buena apuesta y quizás hasta te solvente algún problema.\n"}]}

We are driven by our vision to “Build Hong Kong as a Playful City”. The basic principles behind the Playful City Framework are that every child is recognised as a valued, respected citizen, and every child is engaged to express or participate in decisions to play. Through our programmes, services, and advocacy work, we seek societal commitment to meet the play needs of every child at policy, planning and provision level. Come join our team of playworkers, hospital play specialists, and playground consultants.\n‘Value Children, Value Play’ – that’s the motto.\n2\tJob Description\n2.1\tHospital Play Services\nHospital play refers to activities and programs that are specifically designed for children who are hospitalized. These activities may include play, recreation, and education and are intended to provide a sense of normalcy and support the emotional well-being of hospitalized children. Hospital play programs may include activities such as arts and crafts, games, music, and storytelling and may be provided by trained play specialists, volunteers, or other members of the healthcare team. Hospital play programs are often tailored to the needs and interests of individual children, and may be adjusted to accommodate different age groups, developmental levels, and medical conditions. The goal of hospital play is to help children cope with the stress and uncertainty of being in the hospital and to provide them with enjoyable and engaging activities that can support their overall health and well-being.\nPlayright provides Hospital Play Services at six public hospitals, closely collaborating with healthcare professionals to provide psychosocial support to hospitalised children by using various PLAY interventions throughout their patient pathway. We support the child, their family and the medical team to strengthen holistic paediatric care and mitigate the stress and potential trauma that hospitalised and sick children may experience.\n2.2\tJob Duties & Responsibilities:\n1)\tWork collaboratively with the Clinical and Training Managers to support case management, professional development, policies, manuals, and toolkits for art & leisure.\n2)\tPlan and monitor resources for meeting the project outputs and outcomes.\n3)\tDesign the manpower structure, including assessing risks and discussing with the supervisor and senior team members, to maximise talent, productivity and strategic planning.\n4)\tSupervise daily project activities in art & leisure and service operation, including budgeting and evaluation, also the administrative and managerial duties, including reporting and budgeting.\n5)\tProvide guidance and mentorship to the team, facilitate personal and professional growth, and contribute to training on psychosocial aspects of hospitalised children and their families to other healthcare professionals, parents and public in general.\n6)\tDevelop strong communication and work collaboration with key stakeholders, including funder(s), hospital management, healthcare professionals, and community partners and participate in networking.\n7)\tSupport advocacy work for the welfare of child patients and fund-raising events as needed, such as writing articles for service’s newsletter.\n8)\tPerform any ad hoc Hospital Play projects as assigned by the supervisor.\n\n2.3\tRequirements\n1)\tDegree holder in either discipline of Psychology, Nursing, Child Care, Social Work or Education\n2)\tMin. 5 years’ relevant experience work experience in project management\n3)\tLove to work or play with children\n4)\tExperience in serving special needs children is a plus\n\n2.4\tOther Benefits:\n1)\t5-day work week with flexible work hours\n2)\tTransportation Allowance\n3)\tMedical insurance\n4)\tTraining opportunities\n \nAbout Playright\n3\tVision\nTo build a society that respects, protects and fulfills a Child’s Right to Play, where children can enjoy their childhood.\n4\tMission\nTo advocate the value of play and seek societal commitment to meet the play needs of every child at policy, planning and provision level.\n5\tValues\n1)\tProfessional: Mastering knowledge of play, possessing abundant experiences, putting theories into practice, professionalism, professional ethics, professional competency\n2)\tPassionate: Child-centred, persevere, forward-looking, challenge taker, achieving goals at whatever costs\n3)\tEmpowering: Sharing with partners, equipping professionals, enhancing the network of play\n6\tHong Kong\nAmid rapid urbanisation in Hong Kong, there is a lack of space and resources for meaningful play especially among underprivileged children and families.\nTo address this unfulfilled need, Playright advocates children’s need and right to play and aims to create quality playspace and play experience for ALL children in our city.\n7\tLeader’s Message\n7.1\tOur future is our children, and our children’s future is the present!\nIt is the shared responsibility of the Government and society to take collective actions to make Hong Kong fit for our children. There is an urgent need to have a total review of our child-related system from policy, strategic planning, organisation and services provision levels using a right-based, life-course and ecological approach. Playright’s mandate to advocate children’s play is firmly rooted in the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989. Children’s play should be non-compulsory, driven by intrinsic motivations and undertaken for its own sake. Through our services and programmes, we demonstrate the value of play that is led by children. Nevertheless, to make play advocacy sustainable and scalable, empowering adults and professionals, as well as building partnerships are essential. We are glad to see wider recognition of play. I hope more people and groups will join us to make Hong Kong a better place for our children.\n(by Dr Chow Chun-bong, BBS, JP, Honorary Advisor of Playright Children’s Play Association)\n7.2\tLet’s build Hong Kong to be a Playful City!\nWe are driven by our vision to “Build Hong Kong as a Playful City,” a vision set out on our 30th birthday. The basic principles behind the Playful City Framework are that every child is recognised as a valued, respected citizen, and every child is engaged to express or participate in decisions to play.\nWe want to inspire our community to focus on four areas: namely, Playable Space, Play Provision, Play Time and Playful Adult. We are excited about these initiatives and we are grateful to our long-term and new partners who share our vision and support our work. We will work together with all stakeholders, learning from international best practices, in advocating the landscape of play in Hong Kong.\nThis is not only for children; but also for ALL children and citizens of all ages—meaning you and me.\n(by Anita Ma Wai-man, Chairperson of Playright Children’s Play Association)\n7.3\tLimitations to Play in a Society\nThere are many ways in which countries or societies can violate or undermine the right of children to play. Some examples include:\n1)\tLack of access to safe and accessible playgrounds and other recreational spaces: In some countries, children may not have access to safe and accessible playgrounds and other recreational spaces where they can engage in play and recreational activities. This can be due to a lack of funding for playgrounds, the absence of laws and regulations to protect children’s right to play, or other factors.\n2)\tOverly structured and adult-directed play: In some cases, children may be discouraged from engaging in free and imaginative play, and instead are expected to participate in overly structured and adult-directed activities. This can deprive children of the opportunity to develop their own interests and skills, and to explore and learn through play.\n3)\tHigh levels of violence and conflict: In some societies, high levels of violence and conflict can make it unsafe for children to play outside or engage in other forms of outdoor play. This can have a negative impact on children’s physical and emotional well-being, as well as their ability to engage in play and other recreational activities.\n4)\tEconomic inequality: Economic inequality can also impact children’s ability to play and engage in recreational activities. For example, children from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have access to the same opportunities for play and recreation as children from more privileged families. This can create disparities in children’s access to play, and can have negative long-term effects on their development and well-being.\nOverall, there are many ways in which countries and societies can violate or undermine children’s right to play. It is important for governments and other stakeholders to take steps to protect and promote this right, in order to support the overall development and well-being of children.\n8\tEstablished in 1987\nPlayright Children’s Play Association (Playright) is a charity founded by Mrs Marden and other co-founders in 1987 in Hong Kong. Rooted in Hong Kong for several decades, Playright has all along pursued the mission of advocating children’s play because we “Value Children, Value Play.”\n9\tSafeguard Article 31 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child\nAccording to the Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), all children have the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child, and to participate fully in cultural life and artistic life.\n9.1.1\tThe Convention on the Rights of the Child\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child is an international treaty that was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1989. It sets out the rights that are to be afforded to children, including the right to education, healthcare, protection from violence and exploitation, and the right to participate in cultural and artistic activities. The Convention is the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history, with all but two member states of the United Nations have ratified it. It is also the only human rights treaty that provides for the participation of children in decision-making processes that affect them.\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises the right of every child to engage in play and leisure activities, which are essential for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral, and social development. Article 31 of the Convention states that “State Parties recognise the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts.” The Convention also recognises the importance of play in promoting the physical and mental health of children and in fostering their creativity and imagination. It calls on States Parties to provide children with the necessary facilities and opportunities to engage in play and recreational activities and to take appropriate measures to protect children from harmful forms of work that may interfere with their right to play.\nIn addition to recognising the right of children to play, the Convention also emphasises the importance of play in children's overall development and well-being. Article 29 of the Convention states that education should be directed towards “the development of the child’s personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential.” Play is an essential part of this process, as it can help children develop their physical, social, emotional and cognitive skills.\n9.1.2\tThe basis from the ten principles outlined in the European Association for Children in Hospital (EACH) Charter\n1)\tChildren should only be admitted to the hospital if the care they need cannot be provided at home or daily.\n2)\tChildren in the hospital have the right to have their parents or parent substitutes with them at all times.\n3)\tParents should be offered accommodation and should not incur additional costs or suffer loss of income. They should be kept informed about ward routine and their active participation should be encouraged.\n4)\tChildren and parents have the right to be informed in a manner appropriate to their age and understanding, and steps should be taken to mitigate physical and emotional stress.\n5)\tChildren and parents have the right to informed participation in all decisions involving their health care, and every child should be protected from unnecessary medical treatment and investigation.\n6)\tChildren should be cared for together with other children who have the same developmental needs, and there should be no age restrictions for visitors to children in the hospital.\n7)\tChildren should have full opportunity for play, recreation, and education suited to their age and condition, and should be in an environment designed, furnished, staffed, and equipped to meet their needs.\n8)\tChildren should be cared for by staff with the training and skills necessary to respond to their physical, emotional, and developmental needs.\n9)\tContinuity of care should be ensured by the team caring for children.\n10)\tChildren should be treated with tact and understanding, and their privacy should be respected at all times.\n10\tPromote the Development of Children’s Play\nWe hope to create free play for each and every child during their growth, and equip adults with knowledge about children’s play to satisfy every child’s needs for play through the following work: arranging play services, conducting assessment of play needs, organising play activities, creating play resources, operating play spaces, developing professional training on play, launching new play projects, providing safety assessment and consultancy services in play environments, promoting the development of local inclusive play spaces, promoting child participation, conducting research and surveys, as well as promotion and advocacy work.\n11\tBeneficiaries\nIn 2019-20, the number of beneficiaries receiving our services reached 229,630 and the number of beneficiaries receiving our training was 10,179. Amongst them, there are children, parents, teachers, community partners, and professionals from the medical and design fields.\n12\tFuture Development\nFor the future decade, we aim to turn Hong Kong into a “Playful City” where every playground will be safe, accessible, playful and inclusive for all; every hospital with a Paediatric department will include a hospital play service; child-led community play spaces will be available in 18 districts all over Hong Kong and free play time will be extended from kindergartens to all early childhood settings and primary schools, regardless of ability levels.\nMilestones\n1987 – Estbalishment of Playright\n1989 – HK’s 1st accessible playground in King’s Park with Urban Council was established\n1993 - Published research of ‘Hospital Play Services in Hong Kong’; Opened a reference library; and created playground in Hei Ling Chau and Chi Ma Wan Detention Centre\n1994 – International Play Association Asia Pacific Regional Play Conference; Launch service at Queen Mary Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital and Kwong Wah Hospital\n1995 – Jointly officer ‘Certificate in Hospital Play Specialists Training’; Research release seminar ‘Play Behaviour in Public Housing Estate Playgrounds’; Play service set up at Tai Lan Centre for Women\n1996 – Housing Play Scheme of residential estates with Sun Hung Kai Properties\n1997 – 1st strategic plan established; Research release cum seminar on ‘A New Chapter in Paediatric Healthcare’; Opening of HK’s 1st Play Resources Centre at Kwai Chung; Hospital play outreach programme for pre-schools\n1998 – Regular inspection of all playground facilites of Hong Kong Housing Authority\n1999 – ‘Adventure Play Festival’ in Victoria Park\n2000 – Playground safety inspection course by RoSPA UK and expert from USA;“PlayStreet” in Charter Road; Station at school to organise play\n2001 – Manage and operate the toy library of HK Central Library; Release research on “Children’s Play from Perspective of Toy Library Users”\n2002 – Change the name from “Playright Children’s Playground Association” to “Playright Children’s Play Association”; Design a friendly environment for Caritas Medical Centre; ‘Adventure Playpark’ in Ma On Shan Park; Service to discharged child patients with chronic illnesses\n2003 – Join the Alliance for a Children’s Commission; Play packs for hospitalised children and those quarantined in campsites during the SARS period\n2004 – Discussion of the setup of a Children’s Commission; Launch Playmobile service; ‘Small Space.

Play is driven by intrinsic motivations and undertaken for its own sake, rather than as a means to an end. Play may take infinite forms but the key characteristics of play are fun, uncertainty, challenge, and flexibility.\n26\tWhy Should Children Play? \n26.1\tChildren’s Right\nAs stated in the Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: “all children have the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and artistic life.”\n26.2\tGlobal Concern\nThe adverse effects of inadequate play on children’s growth are not only affecting Hong Kong, but also prevail around the globe. The worrisome phenomenon has aroused global concern. Hence, in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development passed by the United Nations in 2015, most of the 17 goals stipulated are related to children’s play.\nHong Kong should not fall behind.\n26.2.1\t2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a plan of action adopted by the United Nations in 2015. It consists of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) that aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all people.\nSome of the goals and targets that relate to children include:\n1)\tGoal 1: End poverty in all its forms. Target 1.2: Reduce the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.\n2)\tGoal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. Target 4.1: Ensure that by 2030 all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care, and preprimary education so that they are ready for primary education.\n3)\tGoal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. Target 16.2: End abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and all forms of violence against and torture of children.\n27\tBenefits of Play\nA lot of research conducted in the past pointed out the benefits and values of play, including physical development, sociability and communication, cognitive thinking, incubating creativity, expressing emotions, nurturing concentration ability, problem solving, self-understanding, taking challenges, building self-confidence etc. As explained in detail in the thesis issued by the International Play Association in 2014, play is crucial in the development and growth of children. The thesis titled “Power of Play” issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2018 also restated the importance of play, and even advised doctors to use “play” as a new prescription to promote children’s health.\n27.1\tThe Power of Play thesis\nThe “Power of Play” thesis provides guidance to doctors on how to incorporate play into their practice and promote play in children’s daily lives. The thesis recommends that doctors:\n1)\tEducate parents and caregivers about the importance of play and the benefits it provides for children’s development and well-being.\n2)\tEncourage parents and caregivers to create opportunities for play in their child’s daily routine, including structured play activities and unstructured playtime.\n3)\tHelp parents and caregivers to understand the different types of play and their benefits, such as imaginative play, physical play, and social play.\n4)\tAdvise parents and caregivers to limit the use of screen time and other sedentary activities, and to encourage their children to engage in regular physical activity through play.\n5)\tProvide guidance to parents and caregivers on how to support their child’s play, including how to facilitate and encourage play, how to provide a safe play environment, and how to respond to their child’s play.\n6)\tEncourage parents and caregivers to play with their children, as this can help to strengthen the parent-child bond and provide opportunities for bonding and social interaction.\n\nThe thesis also recommends that doctors:\n1)\tUse play as a therapeutic tool to help children cope with stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues.\n2)\tUse play to help children develop their cognitive, physical, emotional, and social skills.\n3)\tUse play as a way to diagnose and assess children’s development, behavior, and mental health.\n4)\tUse play as a way to prescribe and promote healthy habits and behaviors, such as regular physical activity and healthy eating.\nProfessional Work\n28\tPlay & Playwork\nFor the healthy growth of children, play should be an integral part of children’s life at school, at home and in the community. To achieve the above, play opportunities and adults’ support are crucial. Playright’s Play and Playwork hub strives to create play and satisfy the needs of every child through a variety of demonstrations and empowerment, including organising activities, arrangement of professional training, provision of play resources and operation of play spaces.\nIn future decade, we aim to extend free play time from kindergartens to all early childhood settings, special schools and primary schools, and to make child-led community play spaces available in 18 districts all over Hong Kong.\n28.1\tPlay in School\nChildren start their schooling at an early age. Hence, it would be ideal if play could be integrated into their school life. Starting from 2011, we have introduced play in special schools. Through demonstration, training for teachers, on-site consultancy and de-briefing and parents’ talks, we have helped teachers to arrange free play on their own. In response to the requirement that “half-day and whole-day kindergartens should arrange children to participate in free play lasting for no less than 30 and 50 minutes respectively every day” stipulated in the “Kindergarten Education Curriculum Guide” issued by the Education Bureau in early 2017, we seized the opportunity to launch the “Seed School Training Programme”. With different characteristics of schools in mind, we arranged demonstration, training and on-site consultancy and de-briefing to equip school teachers master the skills of arranging free play. We hope that the concept of “Seed Schools” will be expanded so that free play time can be extended from kindergartens to all pre-school settings, special schools and primary schools.\n28.2\tPlay in Community & Outreach\nChildren’s holistic growth is related to the community. If people in the communities accept children’s play, support play and even create play, children can grow more healthily. Hence, we began the trial of community play in 2012. In 2013, we launched a 3-year project titled “The Playbourhood” and implemented in different phases in Tin Shui Wai, Wong Tai Sin, Sau Mau Ping and Tseung Kwan O. \n28.2.1\tPlay in Neighborhood\nIn 2017, we introduced another 3-year project named “Playful Community League” which was implemented in Tai Po, Lai Chi Kok, Central Western District and Kwai Tsing. We aim to motivate the residents, community groups and organisations to join and collaborate their efforts to build up an atmosphere of free play and to establish a regular play space in the community parks so as to create a playful community for children.\nWe hope that there will be a child-led play space in every community and this concept can blossom in all 18 districts in Hong Kong so that every little neighbour can benefit from play.\n28.3\tIndoor Play\nFor children who want to play every day without worrying about the weather conditions, a quality indoor play space is what they need. To address the need, the HSBC PlayScope was officially opened in 2009 to be our first free play centre which is wholly designed and operated by Playright.\nAfter years of evolution and upgrading, more and more new and playful facilities and resources are provided at PlayScope. It now opens in a better operation mode and in all-weather which becomes the rare play space provided around the clock. Children from all communities are welcomed to join and grow happily and healthy in play.\nIn addition to its popularity among children and parents, PlayScope is also a good model of indoor free play space. It has attracted a lot of local and overseas organisations for visits and exchanges.\n28.4\tCommunity Outreach\nIn order to provide more play opportunities for little neighbours in the community, we have specially set up a community outreach service. We organise and promote quality and creative play in mobile basis for government departments, kindergartens, primary schools, social welfare organisations, commercial organisations, etc. Apart from providing a one-stop service, we also set up a good model for the community and promote a playful atmosphere.\n28.5\tPlay in Library\nStarting from 2001, Playright has been operating and managing the Toy Library in the Hong Kong Central Library to serve the citizens of Hong Kong. Since May 2021, we have adopted a brand new concept of “Enjoy Reading, Value Playing”.\nReading and playing are essential to all children. Reading comes alive when it is nested in play, and children can play within and beyond the stories. Through integrating reading and playing in the Toy Library, children can have fun – and lots of it!\nThe Toy Library is managed by a group of professional playworkers. All playworkers put children’s play needs as the core of their work, from the selection of picture books to the creation of play ideas, from the setting of seasonal themes to the play facilitation in general sessions and workshops.\n29\tHospital Play\nPlay is children’s basic need. Even when they are sick, their natural instinct does not change. Our Hospital Play, which commenced in 1994, is targeted at child patients. The service helps children to engage in play during their pathway of fighting an illness and being hospitalised, as well as to understand medical procedures, the environment and what is happening in their lives intellectually and psychologically. Apart from looking after children, we also support their families and partner with medical professionals to develop and promote hospital play and conduct research so as to strengthen holistic paediatric care.\nIn future decade, we aim to make every hospital with a Paediatric department include a hospital play service, thus letting play become an integral part of the growth of every sick child.\n29.1\tMedial Collaboration\nCurrently, Playright provides a regular honorary hospital play service at 6 public hospitals in 5 clusters. The hospitals receiving our service include the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital of the Hong Kong East cluster, the Caritas Medical Centre and the Princess Margaret Hospital of the Kowloon West cluster, the Tseung Kwan O Hospital of the Kowloon East cluster, the Hong Kong Children’s Hospital of the Kowloon Central Cluster, as well as the Prince of Wales Hospital of the New Territories East cluster.\nFor the benefit of sick children, our hospital play specialists are stationed at hospitals every weekday and work closely with the other professionals including doctors, nurses, specialist medical staff and ward staff. In view of different treatments and different illnesses, the hospital play specialists create partnerships with the medical team to design a tailor-made hospital play plan for the sick children. Apart from the daily hospital play, the hospital play specialists have also co-operated with hospitals in response to the outbreak of SARS, Human Swine flu and lead-in-drinking-water in housing estates with regard to calming children through routine medical procedures such as blood taking and/or being put in isolation.\n29.1.1\tPreparation Play\nWe prepare children psychologically for upcoming medical procedures and treatments in order to reduce their stress and anxiety, including chemotherapy, hemodialysis, CT scan, blood taking and many others.\n29.1.2\tDistraction Play\nWe help children cope with pain and anxiety during medical procedures by distracting them with interesting games and toys.\n29.1.3\tMedical Play\nThrough medical toys, we provide children with opportunities to learn some medical knowledge and express their feelings towards their illness.\n29.1.4\tTherapeutic Play\nWe provide tailor-made play services to children and teenagers who are suffering from behavioral problems, eating disorders or child abuse for helping them to build up a more healthy and happy life in the future.\n29.1.5\tDevelopmental Play\nWe provide appropriate play activities for children to have optimum psychobgical and psychosocial development during hospitalisation.\n29.1.6\tPlayright Channel\nPlayright introduced Hong Kong’s first-ever interactive hospital television channel in 2006. A lively monthly variety and game show broadcast in paediatric wards gives every child, even those confined to isolation wards, a chance to play and communicate with children in other wards. It is a valuable means for children to have fun through play and receive support from the community.\n29.1.7\tPatient Play Group\nThis play group, established by hospital play specialists, focuses on the voice of children. We encourage child patients to join the group to discover their individual potential, promote their self-values and developing strong mutual support for each other through different kinds of play activities.\n29.1.8\tLittle Star Project\nWe provide medical play workshops for preschool and primary school children, helping them understand more about hospitalisation and encouraging them to show their concern to hospital child patients.\n29.1.9\tVolunteer Play Service in Ward\nVolunteers are a valuable resource for the hospital play service. They not only help us to provide play service for hospitalised children, but advocate our mission and let the public know the importance of hospital play through their personal experiences\n29.1.10\tHospital Play Training & Workshops\nOur professional hospital play specialists have visited many more hospitals to offer their expert opinion to the healthcare professionals and volunteers in the design and provision of appropriate play as well as the special skills needed when playing with children under medical care. Besides, we will provide related talks and courses to different nursing schools and health professional associations by invitation.\n29.2\tChild-friendly Environment, Play & Leisure Activities\nThe ward environment can have a great influence on patients. Child patients are no exception. Hence, our service has always included creating a joyful hospital atmosphere. For example, we assist in developing a child-friendly ward and decorate for special occasions such as birthdays, festive seasons and celebrations for discharge.\nIn the playroom of the Princess Margaret Hospital and the Caritas Medical Centre, we have introduced toys and play that comply with the hygienic standards of the ward. The play and toys provided suit the needs of children of different ages and include board games, card games, and creative handicrafts. We even provide a tricycle in the ward and flour play at the specialist out-patients department.\nTaking hospitalised children outside is also one of our aims. From time to time, the hospital play specialists arrange different activities such as play days, baking-a-cookie classes, one-day trips to theme parks, life camps, and even adventure trips so that the children can enjoy leisure and be involved in a life appropriate to their age.\n29.3\tCommunity Partnerships\nThe interactive TV platform “Playright Channel” (https://www.youtube.com/user/playrighthk), launched in 2006. Is jointly organised by the hospital play specialists, the Community Health Resource Centre of the Princess Margaret Hospital and different NGOs. For child patients in the ordinary ward and isolation ward, the Channel regularly provides opportunities of coming into contact with the outside world.\nIn order to connect with child patients, we work closely with different patients groups such as the Kid Friend’s Club, the KID’s Dream Choir, the Little Life Warriors Society, the Children’s Kidney Fund, the Children’s Heart Foundation, etc. In addition, we also closely connect with different volunteer groups and corporate volunteers so as to increase resources and amass the power of caring for sick children.\n29.4\tTraining & Consultancy\nCollaboration with medical professionals is crucial in implementing hospital play. It is also important to train more people to be involved in hospital play. Over the years, we have continually organised seminars, workshops and training for the medical team of different hospitals. From 1995 onwards, we have joined hands with the HKU School of Professional And Continuing Education (HKU-SPACE) to organise a course on “Certificate in Theory and Practice of Hospital Play” to further the localisation of professional hospital play development.\nTo raise professional standards and update on trends in the medical field, our hospital play specialists often participate in local medical seminars and forums. From time to time, they also join international conferences or study professional courses so as to integrate new knowledge, experience and skills into their work.\nAs regards the exploration of hospital play by the medical field or enquires from cross-sectors, we are pleased to share our experiences or provide consultancy services.\n29.5\tPrimary Healthcare in a three-tier System\nWe believe in play and that children should be entitled to play even when they are sick. To actualise our beliefs, we commenced our hospital play service in 1994, gradually integrating ourselves into Hong Kong’s three-tier healthcare system—children’s hospitals, district hospitals and primary care.\nOver the years, we have strived to provide quality hospital play to child patients regardless of their ailment, catering for their cognitive, physical and emotional needs throughout different stages of illness, as well as those of their families.\n29.5.1\tHong Kong Children’s Hospital - since Dec. 2018\nProvide hospital play services in wards, specialist outpatient clinics and radiology departments for children with severe, complex, rare diseases, as well as those in need of multidisciplinary specialist treatment.\n29.5.2\tDistrict Hospital - since 1994\nServe children in five hospitals across four clusters, namely Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Tseung Kwan O Hospital, Caritas Medical Centre, Princess Margaret Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital.\n29.5.3\tPrimary Care - since 2005\nServe pre-school children in Kwai Tsing and Sham Shui Po Districts via the Little Star Project since 2005; In partnership with the Kwai Tsing and Sham Shui Po District Health Centres through the “Medical Play Experiential Box” initiative since November 2020.\n\nWith the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resurgence of asymptomatic cases, anyone is at risk of getting infected and hospitalised. In this period of uncertainty, we consider the “Medical Play Experiential Box” a playful and effective means to get children well-prepared ahead of time. To promote this concept among the healthcare sector, we held a launching ceremony on 21 November 2020.\nIt was our great honour to have Dr Lam Ching-choi, a specialist in Paediatrics and a non-official member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong, as our Honourable Guest of Honour to witness the birth of the “Medical Play Experiential Box”, along with representatives from the healthcare sector, social services sector and guests participating online. Other Guests of Honour included Dr Lee Tsz-leung, Hospital Chief Executive of Hong Kong Children’s Hospital; Dr Patrick Ip Pak-keung, President of The Hong Kong Paediatric Society; Ms Chan Yim-fan, Vice President of Hong Kong College of Paediatric Nursing; Ms Chan Yuk-ming, President of Hong Kong Paediatric Nurses Association; Dr Chow Chun-bong, Honourary Advisor of Playright Children’s Play Association; Ms Anita Ma Wai-man, Chairperson of the Executive Committee of Playright Children’s Play Association; and Dr Victor Koong Hing-yeung, Co-Vice Chairperson of the Executive Committee of Playright Children’s Play Association.\nWe were also deeply encouraged by the support of many doctors and nurses, who took time out of their fight against the pandemic to attend the ceremony online. Their positive response once again reaffirmed the value of the “Medical Play Experiential Box”.\n29.6\tAims for advocacy\nDeveloped by Playright’s Hospital Play Service team, the “Medical Play Experiential Box” consists of picture books, videos and playpacks which present correct information about illnesses and treatments in a child-friendly manner. Together, these measures represent a comprehensive package that assists children with psychological and cognitive preparation, reducing their anxiety and establishing a positive impression of hospitalisation. To promote the “Medical Play Experiential Box”, we have been actively seeking recognition from various sectors. We were privileged to have Dr Patrick Ip Pak-keung, President of The Hong Kong Paediatric Society, to feature in our video to offer his endorsement to our programme from his professional viewpoint as a doctor.\nWe also had the full support of Dr Maggie Koong May-kay, an early childhood education specialist, who made an appearance in another video to analyse the benefits of the “Medical Play Experiential Box” to children from child development perspectives. In the same episode, Dr Alan Wong Yan-ho and his wife Rendy Ng Ka-man gave highly relatable remarks on parents’ anxiety about children’s sickness.\nFundraising\n30\tFundraising Campaigns\n30.1\tPlayright Little Play Space Co-creation Box and Mini Model Online Exhibition 2022-2023\nThe Little Play Space Co-creation Box Campaign 2022-2023 is a fundraising project designed and organised by Playright Children’s Play Association. The Co-creation box promotes creative thinking and encourages the exploration of possibilities with loose parts between parents and children. Create your “Dream Playable Play Space in Neighbourhood” together in four steps - Experience, Explore, Express and Share!\n30.2\t#PlayChallenge @Urban Playground 2.0\nOver the last two years during the COVID-19 pandemic, working or studying at home was unavoidable. Feelings of boredom was very common among young people. And the stress of being stuck indoors challenged our well-being.\nPlayright is calling on all children and adults alike to go outdoors and play! We believe that through play, our community can come together to ignite joy, positivity, and perhaps even a bit of normalcy by having some outdoor fun.\nWhat’s New\n31\t2022 Oct 17 – Welcome our new Executive Director\nDear Friends of Playright,   \nFor more than 30 years, Playright Children’s Play Association (Playright) has been steadfast in our commitment to advocate for the value of play and seek societal commitment to meet the play needs of every child at the policy, planning and provision level.

The prolonged and increasing severity of the outbreak, stringent measures on social distancing for public health, suspension of school and child facilities are all an unexpected ordeal. Children experience loss of normality, loss of routine, decreased outdoor activities and disconnection with familiar faces. Sick children, children with special needs and those that are requiring hospitalisation face multiple barriers that restrict their day-to-day opportunities to play.\nAs an NGO advocating for the Child’s Right to Play in Hong Kong, we are concerned about the challenging circumstances arising from COVID-19. Opportunities for play is crucial to children’s well-being, mental and physical health. It has a significant therapeutic value in recovering a sense of normality and joy for children, as well as in alleviating harmful effects of stress and building resilience, especially in the situation of a crisis.\nChildren have a spontaneous urge to play, and they rely on adults to provide play opportunities for them. It is our duty to ensure children will be able to play in such a difficult situation.\nOur hearts go to the children in hospitals, especially when all our Hospital Play Specialists have no access to the children we serve in six public hospitals after the emergency response level was activated on 25 January, 2020 by the Hospital Authority. The Hospital Play Specialist team immediately developed age-appropriate playpacks, games, videos, play posters...... to connect, explain and “play” with the child patients through the support of medical professionals.\nThe team reached out to children suffering from COVID-19, as much as connect with patient support groups to share our play resources for children with chronic health condition in the community.\nAcknowledging that we are still operating with uncertainty about the future, the Hospital Play Specialist team continues to be open, imaginative and practical in redesigning the service, without losing sight of our missions and the needs of children. Nevertheless, we look beyond the The coronavirus pandemic has been an enormous challenge to everyone, especially children.

As an NGO advocating for the Child’s Right to Play in Hong Kong, we are concerned about the challenging circumstances arising from COVID-19. Opportunities for play is crucial to children’s well-being, mental and physical health. It has a significant therapeutic value in recovering a sense of normality and joy for children, as well as in alleviating harmful effects of stress and building resilience, especially in the situation of a crisis. Children have a spontaneous urge to play, and they rely on adults to provide play opportunities for them. It is our duty to ensure children will be able to play in such a difficult situation.\nProtecting a Child’s Right to Play in times of the Coronavirus Outbreak implication of Hospital Play Specialists not being allowed to support the child patients alongside the medical and nursing professionals, especially when the hospital play service is most needed. The value of play for child patients has been well documented, and similar services continue in other parts of the world where such services are established. It is time for Hong Kong to critically review and include hospital play as part of the essential provision for paediatric patients.\nPlayright had an opportunity to join hands with play experts around the world to develop resources “Play in Crisis: Support for Parents and Carers”, and Playright has translated it into Chinese. It has undoubtedly expanded our horizon as a play advocate in the four impact areas – Play Space, Play Provision, Play Time and Play Adults.\nHow will COVID-19 change the landscape of play advocacy in Hong Kong? As a non-official member of the Commission on Children, we also express concern whether our policy decisions are made with a child-perspective, including the anti-epidemic related measures. It should be time for us to review the impact on children and consider the aftermath of the pandemic.\nThe implication of COVID-19 is not at all evil. We perceive it as an opportunity to reimagine a “New Normality” for children’s play, for Playright, Hong Kong and for the world. Life will not be the same, but we can work together to make it better for children. Playright has committed to inspire and contribute, making Hong Kong a “Playful City” where the play need of All children can be realised with the support of adults, playtime, play space and play policy. Yes, we need responsive adults who understand the need for play, supportive communities where playing is celebrated, and policies that are sensitive to children’s play needs and put children’s well-being as the priority!\n32.1\tA New Challenge\nSome physical conditions of hospitalised children prevent them from enjoying playpacks. So, how should we respond to their play needs, considering multiple conditions and demands? In response, our hospital play specialists kicked-off a video production, creating a new version of our Hospital Play Channel.\nOur Hospital Play Channel was introduced in 2005, to conduct interactive play with child patients in isolation rooms via real-time video platforms. In the face of the latest pandemic, our hospital play specialists utilised this valuable experience to create the 2020 version of the Hospital Play Channel, where storytelling, music sharing, as well as interactive play came alive.\nDuring the Lunar New Year, our hospital play specialists used the video channel to attend to the children’s anticipation of the festival in various ways, including the “Twelve Zodiac Stories” about the origin of the Chinese zodiacs and “New Spring Little Rat” about making traditional New Year decoration (“Fai chuns”), thereby creating a festive atmosphere for the hospitalised children.\nShifting from serving children from the hospital bedside to conducting play within a camera frame was initially a huge challenge for our hospital play specialists as beginners at videographing. From storywriting, preparatory work, video shooting, to post-production, we took everything on ourselves. Simple as it seems, every story was carefully developed from research in books or the Internet and enriched through creativity, in the hope that children would enjoy the final product, along with acquiring accurate information. During production, our hospital play specialists transformed into directors,set designers, boom operators, cameramen, editors, etc., undergoing processes of attempts, exploration, revision and re-dos in aspects of camera angles, equipment operation and use of editing software. As you can imagine, every dialogue and camera shot in each video clip are the fruits of painstaking yet heartfelt labour.\nChildren in the hospital are the core existence of our hospital play specialists. Therefore, we desire to return back to the wards as soon as possible, demonstrating procedure play in person, listening to them and sharing their worries. Of course, if Hong Kong’s hospitals incorporated hospital play into the regular services in paediatric wards and made our hospital play specialists as formal members of the ward team, we would still be able to work on the frontline, contributing to the child patients’ well-being, regardless of any raging pandemic or not!\n33\tIntervention Research on Children’s Free Play: Parents’ Perspectives 2021\n33.1\tExecutive Summary\nThis study was undertaken in Hong Kong, in which the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on people from all walks of life was evident. Various preventive measures were enforced, including the closure of many outdoor playgrounds and the suspension of face-to-face contact in schools. These preventive measures impacted children because of the restrictions on their use of public facilities for leisure activities.\nPlayright has always promoted free play in Hong Kong and had considerable concerns about the impact of the pandemic on children’s play. In this regard, Playright developed a free play protocol that was implemented either in self-organised programmes or in partnership with some kindergartens. Against this backdrop, this study examined the evidence-based outcomes of the protocol.\n33.2\tResearch Objectives\nThe study aimed to examine parents’ perceptions of free play, parents’ engagement with their child in free play, and the possible influences of free play on parents’ mental health and parent-child relationships. Specifically, this study aimed to address research areas, including\n1)\tParents’ perceptions of free play;\n2)\tParents’ engagement in free play with their children;\n3)\tBarriers and difficulties faced by parents in engaging in free play with their children;\n4)\tThe outcomes of free play, specifically on parent-child relationships and parents’ mental health.\n33.3\tMethodology\nPart A of the study investigated the effectiveness of the PLAYBAG intervention protocol in three kindergartens. Target participants were parents who participated in the PLAYBAG programme in these three kindergartens. A mixed-methods approach was adopted to collect quantitative pre- and post-intervention data by questionnaires capturing parents’ perceptions of free play, their engagement with their children in free play, their mental health and their relationship with their children. Parents participated in focus group interviews to inform understanding of their engagement in free play with their children. Thematic analysis was employed to analyse the data from the focus group interviews.\nPart B comprised a cross-sectional and quantitative investigation of parents’ perceptions of free play, their participation in free play with their children and their relationships with their children. Target respondents were parents involved in the ‘Playright Home Play Box’ and ‘Medical Play Experiential Box’ activities organised by Playright between April 2020 and May 2021.\n33.4\tFindings\nPart A confirmed the evidence-based effectiveness of the PLAYBAG intervention protocol in terms of enhancing parents’ perceptions of free play, fostering positive parent-child relationships, and promoting parents’ mental health. In addition, more than 80% of parents agreed that their child spent more time on PLAYBAG and other free play activities at home and that they had increased confidence engaging in free play activities with their child.\nRegarding the intersection of parents’ perceptions of play and socio-demographic background, Part B found that mothers were more inclined to endorse play freedom than fathers. Fathers embraced play safety more than mothers. Compared to parents with a tertiary or university education, parents with senior high school or below education were more inclined to endorse parental rules, play safety, gender stereotyping, and the importance of structured play and were less inclined to support imaginative play. In terms of play freedom, no significant difference was evident between parents with different levels of education. Parents in full-time employment were less inclined to support parental rules in play. Compared with parents of primary school-aged children, parents of children in kindergarten were less focused on parental rules when engaging in free play with their children. Regarding living space, parents living in confined accommodations were much concerned about safety problems when engaging in free play with their children.\nThis study also examined the intersection of parents’ perceptions of play and parent-child relationships. Closer parent-child interaction and more positive parent-child relationships as a whole were evident among parents who endorsed play freedom and imaginative play. More conflict in parent-child relationships was observed when parents emphasised play safety and gender stereotyping in children’s play. Investigation of the relationship between parental perceptions of play and the average time spent in free play revealed that parents who endorsed play freedom, imaginative play and children’s choices allowed their children to spend more time on free play.\nThis study found that children spent more time in free play with their mother than their father. It identified parents’ long working hours, children’s rest schedules, and limited indoor space as the three most important barriers impacting parents’ engagement in free play with their children. Parents considered female children’s rest schedules the most influential factor affecting free play. Parents of primary school-age children considered the amount of homework as the most influential factor in free play. Parents who emphasised play safety were more likely to consider limited indoor space and difficulty balancing responsibilities as factors influencing their engagement in free play with their children. Moreover, parents who embraced play safety were more inclined to impose rules and regulations on their children in free play. This posed a dilemma for parents in balancing the roles of discipline enforcer and playmate.\nThe focus group interviews provided a fruitful insight into understanding parents’ participation in free play with their children. Four essential elements were identified that facilitated meaningful interaction between parents and children in free play: 1) an egalitarian and non-judgmental attitude, 2) the quality of encounters with children in free play, 3) discoveries about their children, and 4) sustaining new meanings of their children’s identity.\n33.5\tRecommendations\nThe results of this study generated the following recommendations:\n1)\tEnhancement of the PLAYBAG intervention protocol to address the specific needs of parents from different socio-economic backgrounds. For instance, parents’ sessions for fathers, parents with full-time employment, parents with children from different age groups etc. Contents of parents’ sessions could provide more solutions to tackle the dilemmas faced by parents when engaging in free play with their children. More scenarios regarding possible ways to use the unstructured play materials in free play could be added in the parents’ sessions.\n2)\tParental education on free play should be widely implemented in kindergartens and schools through collaboration among different stakeholders in the community, echoing a recent proposal, “Curriculum Framework on Parent Education (Kindergarten)” published by the Education Bureau. Parental education on children’s free play might include principles and benefits of free play, effective ways to engage children in free play, creating quality free play time in families, and co-parenting perspective of engaging fathers and mothers in free play.\n3)\tPromotion of free play to the general public, in particular, to generate an understanding of the importance of free play, and positive outcomes regarding the enhancement of mental health and parent-child relationships, should be emphasised in community education programmes. The pandemic seriously affected parents’ and children’s mental health and well-being, and free play in the home and school environment helped relieve stress and anxiety and enhance family bonding.\n4. The barriers to children’s engagement in free play should be removed. Home-school collaboration needs to be strengthened to enhance parents’ and children’s creativity, participation, and collaboration in free play activities. Teachers’ training regarding free play implementation in school settings are recommended. Policies to streamline the amount of homework given to children and the development of a child-friendly free play school environment are advocated.\n5. Creating an innovative child-friendly free play environment should be promoted through collaboration between different stakeholders in the community. Apart from improving the designated playgrounds provided by Housing Authority and Leisure and Cultural Services Department, different community stakeholders could work together to create various doorstep, indoor or outdoor play space for children and their parents to have free play in safe environment.\n6. Last but not least, consideration should be given to empowering children’s voices to cocreate a free play environment. Different models or tools for children’s participation should be adopted to fit various needs of children. Moreover, trainings are also required for the adults to listen, collect and respect children’s voices in regard to those child-related issues.\n34\tResearch 2014 on the effectiveness of therapeutic play in minimising anxiety and negative emotions of hospitalised children\n34.1\tProject Summary\nObjective: To test the effectiveness of a therapeutic play intervention in minimising the anxiety levels and negative emotions of hospitalised Hong Kong Chinese children.\nMethods: A non-equivalent control group pretest–posttest, between subjects design was conducted in the two largest acute-care public hospitals in Hong Kong. Chinese children (3-12 years of age; n = 304) admitted for treatment in these two hospitals were invited to participate in the study. Of the 304 subjects, 154 received the therapeutic play intervention and 150 received usual care.\nResults: Children who received the therapeutic play intervention reported less negative emotional behaviour and lower levels of anxiety compared to those who received usual care only during hospitalisation.\nConclusion: The study provides empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of therapeutic play interventions in minimising the anxiety and negative emotions of hospitalised children.\nPractice implications: The findings heighten the awareness of the importance of integrating therapeutic play as an essential component of holistic and high-quality care to ease the psychological burden of hospitalised children. It is crucial to have more hospital play specialists to facilitate the integration of therapeutic play into routine care for hospitalised children.\n34.2\tIntroduction\nHospitalisation can be a stressful and threatening experience for everyone, especially for children [1]. The physiological and psychological health needs of children are typically different from those of adults. Children are more vulnerable to the stress of hospitalisation because of their cognitive limitations, lack of self-control, dependence on others, and limited experience and knowledge of the healthcare system [2]. A lack of understanding about the upcoming procedures, unfamiliarity with the hospital environment, and failure to understand the reasons for hospitalisation can add to their anxiety, fear, anger, uncertainty, and feelings of helplessness. Among these negative responses, anxiety is the most commonly reported. Excessive anxiety can be detrimental to children’s physical and psychological health. Anxiety also hinders children’s ability to cope with medical treatment, and encourages negative and uncooperative behaviour toward healthcare. The link between anxiety and negative outcomes suggests that reducing children’s anxiety during periods of hospitalisation could promote better recovery.\nPlay has been widely used in many Western countries to alleviate the stress experienced by paediatric patients and their families during hospitalisation. Erikson and Piaget observed that play is essential for children’s normal growth and development, as it provides an expression of their understanding about the world and an opportunity for them to develop mastery of self and the environment. Indeed, play has long been recognised as a vital element of psychological interventions to help children withstand the stress of hospitalisation.\nFlorence Erickson, a pioneer in the study of play for hospitalised children, emphasised that play is an integral part of children’s lives. Erickson conducted a study to explore the reactions of children to hospital experience and confirmed that children who were given an opportunity to play with clinical equipment were better able to express their feelings about their hospital experiences. She demonstrated the benefits of using play interviews and dolls to prepare hospitalised children for intrusive medical procedures.\n34.3\tPlay Therapy and Therapeutic Play\nAccording to psychoanalytic theory, play therapy is part of child psychiatry and is similar in\nnature to psychotherapy for adults. Erikson described how play therapy benefited children who had experienced trauma or who had behavioural disorders. Over the past decades, play therapy has been widely used by psychotherapists to help children work through their problems during psychotherapy.\nTherapeutic play, in contrast, is a set of structured activities appropriately designed for children’s levels of psychosocial and cognitive development and health-related issues to psychologically prepare them for hospitalisation. The past decade has seen an increase in the use of therapeutic play interventions to help children cope with the stress of hospitalisation. Regrettably, the majority of studies that have studied activities for hospitalised children have been in the form of case studies based on theories and clinical observations. There is a lack of empirical evidence to accurately determine the clinical effectiveness of the therapeutic play. The results of a randomised controlled trial to examine the effects of a therapeutic play intervention on the outcomes of children undergoing day surgery showed that those who received the intervention reported lower state anxiety scores and exhibited fewer instances of negative emotional behaviour in pre- and postoperative periods. Nevertheless, the implications of this study were limited because the children only received minor elective surgeries and did not stay in hospital overnight. Therefore, more empirical evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of therapeutic play in reducing the anxiety levels and negative emotions of hospitalised children. \nIt is well documented that Hong Kong Chinese people are influenced by the philosophy of Confucianism, which emphasises balance and harmony achieved through the concepts of chung and yung in everyday life. Under the influence of this philosophy, disease is regarded as arising from ‘bad spirits’, and it is believed that exercise will only aggravate the disease and violate the rule of harmony. In this cultural context, hospitalised children are often advised by their parents or even healthcare professionals to take more rest and not to engage in any energy-consuming activities, including play activities. Furthermore, as many Chinese parents and some healthcare staff traditionally view play as less important than physiological care or medical treatment, it is not clear whether therapeutic play is an appropriate and feasible psychological intervention for hospitalised children in the Hong Kong Chinese context. Given these issues, this study aimed to test the effectiveness of a therapeutic play intervention in minimising the anxiety and negative emotions of hospitalised Hong Kong Chinese children. Specifically, the focus was on assessing the potential of implementing the therapeutic play intervention for hospitalised children in Hong Kong clinical settings.\n34.4\tTheoretical framework\nThis study was guided by Lazarus and Folkman’s [13] theory of cognitive appraisal, stress and coping, which is one of the most commonly applied theoretical perspectives on how people cope with stress. This transactional model is also the most frequently applied model in research on children [2, 12, 14]. According to Lazarus and Folkman [13], stress is defined as a dynamic ongoing relationship between a person and his or her environment, and cognitive appraisal is the process by which an individual evaluates or judges the meaning of a potentially stressful event and its significance to his or her well-being. \nIt is well documented that hospitalisation can be a highly stressful and anxiety-provoking experience for children and can have profound effects on them. Lazarus and Folkman postulated that individuals’ evaluations are influenced by their perceptions of control over a potential threat. Previous studies have shown that a lack of control over the physical setting of the hospital and upcoming medical procedures is a major source of stress, which may cause considerable anxiety for hospitalised children. We reasoned that if children believe they have adequate control over a potential threat, they will experience less anxiety and report fewer negative emotions. Therefore, a primary goal of the therapeutic play intervention was to assist children in regaining a sense of self-control. We anticipated that conducting the intervention in the hospital would increase children’s familiarity with the hospital environment and thereby enhance their sense of personal control. We also surmised that through participating in play activities, children would develop their interpersonal and communication skills, self-care and social and creative abilities. Children were not only encouraged to have fun, but were also taught to desensitise to potentially stressful situations and to instil a sense of control over the situation in which they were involved. The intervention allowed the children to practise medical or nursing routines through play and interact with the environment in an active and non-threatening rather than passive way. \n34.5\tMethods \n34.5.1\tDesign and sample \nTo examine the effects of the therapeutic play intervention, we used a non-equivalent control group pretest–posttest, between-subjects design. The study was carried out in the two largest acute-care public hospitals in Hong Kong, with one hospital assigned as the “control” and the other as the “experimental” hospital. The two hospitals have similar paediatric specialities, settings, and medical and nursing care. Chinese children admitted for treatment in these two acute public hospitals and who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. The inclusion criteria for eligible children were (1) aged between 3 and 12 years, (2) able to speak Cantonese, and (3) required to stay in hospital for at least three consecutive days. Children with cognitive and learning difficulties identified from their medical records were excluded. \nThe sample size was calculated to ensure sufficient power to detect differences between the groups. With reference to the previous study that examined the effects of therapeutic play intervention on the outcomes of children undergoing day surgery, we predicted a medium effect size for the differences between the two groups. To predict this effect size at a 5% significance level (p < 0.05) and power of 0.80, we calculated that 64 subjects would be required in each group. We allowed for a potential attrition rate of 15%, which is common in experimental designs. Accordingly, 11 additional participants per group were needed to cover the attrition, giving a total sample size of 150. However, according to Piaget, children aged between 3-7 and 8-12 are at the preoperational and concrete operational stages of development, respectively. Because children’s cognitive development is linked to their age, different methods of assessment were used for the two age groups. Therefore, the data analyses were performed separately for the two age groups, 3-7 and 8-12 years. Hence, we aimed to recruit at least 300 (150 in each age group) subjects in this study. \n34.6\tIntervention \nThe control group participants received usual medical and nursing care, while the experimental group participants received around 30 minutes of therapeutic play intervention, which hospital play specialists conducted on each weekday. The content of the therapeutic play included a variety of structured and non-structured activities. The hospital play specialists selected suitable activities in accordance with the children’s sex, age, ability, type of illness, and general condition. The children were also given a choice of play activities. The hospital play specialist documented the timing, duration, and nature of play for each child in a log book. Some examples of the therapeutic play intervention are provided in Table 1. \n34.7\tMeasures\n34.7.1\tDemographic data sheet \nA demographic data sheet constructed for this study was used to record the children’s demographic and clinical characteristics, including their age, gender, diagnosis, and number of hospital admissions.\n34.7.2\tAnxiety levels of children aged between 3 and 7 years 10 \nThe visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess children’s anxiety levels. The VAS consists of a 10 cm horizontal line on a piece of paper, with different facial expressions supplemented by the words ‘not worried’ at one end and ‘very worried’ at the other. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety. Children aged between 5 and 7 used a movable indicator to show their levels of anxiety. However, as children aged 3-4 might have limited verbal expression and cognitive capacities and could be confused by the scale, this age group was assessed by asking the parents to rate their child’s anxiety level. The VAS is one of the most widely used measurement tools because it is easy to administer, simple for children to understand, and is a valid method for measuring subjective feelings [17]. One of the biggest advantages of using the VAS is that it is not affected by the limited test-taking ability of younger children. Previous studies have found the VAS to be a reliable, valid, and sensitive measure of individual subjective feelings. \n34.7.3\tAnxiety levels of children aged between 8 and 12 years \nThe anxiety levels of children in this age group were measured using the short form of the Chinese version of the State Anxiety Scale for Children (CSAS-C). The short form of the CSAS-C consists of 10 items scored from 1 to 3, with total possible scores ranging from 10 to 30. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety. The psychometric properties of the short form of the CSAS-C have been empirically tested [20] and show adequate internal consistency reliability, good concurrent validity, and excellent construct validity. The results of a confirmatory factor analysis added further evidence of the construct validity of the short form of the CSAS-C.\n34.8\tChildren’s Emotional Manifestation Scale (CEMS) \nThe emotional responses of the hospitalised children were documented using the CEMS. The CEMS score is obtained by reviewing the descriptions of behaviour in each category and selecting the number that most closely represents the child’s observed behaviour. Each category is scored from 1 to 5, with summed scores between 5 and 25. Higher scores indicate more negative emotional behaviour. The psychometric properties of the CEMS have been empirically tested and show adequate internal consistency reliability, good inter-rater reliability, and excellent construct validity. \n34.8.1\tProcess evaluation \nTo assess the implementation potential of the therapeutic play intervention, a short one-to-one semi-structured interview was conducted with five children aged between 8 and 12 and with the parents of five children aged between 3 and 12, randomly selected from the experimental group. Children and parents were interviewed separately. They were asked to express their views on the acceptability and suitability of the therapeutic play intervention. In addition, to examine whether it is feasible to implement the therapeutic play intervention in clinical settings and whether it is acceptable to healthcare providers, five nurses working in the paediatric units delivering the therapeutic play intervention were randomly invited for a short interview at the end of the study. All of the interviews were conducted by a full-time research assistant with considerable experience of conducting qualitative interviews. The interviews were taped-recorded.\n34.9\tData collection procedures\nApproval for the study was obtained from the hospital ethics committees. Written consent was obtained from the parents after they were told the purpose of the study. The children and their parents were informed that they had the right to withdraw from the study at any time and were assured of the confidentiality of their data.\nAfter signing the consent form, a research assistant collected the demographic data from the parents and from the children’s medical records. The children’s baseline anxiety levels were also assessed and documented. For the experimental group, the therapeutic play intervention started after the baseline data had been collected. A research assistant observed the emotional behaviour of each child for two consecutive days (4 hours consecutively per day). At the end of the two days’ observation, a research assistant documented the child’s overall emotional behaviour using the CEMS. The child’s anxiety levels were reassessed and documented. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with selected children and their parents. Once the data collection for all participants was completed, a short interview was conducted with selected nurses working in the paediatric units where the therapeutic play intervention was implemented.\n34.10\tData analysis \nThe Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS: Version 19; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows was used for the data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate the means, standard deviations, and ranges of the scores on the various scales. The homogeneity of the experimental and control groups was assessed using inferential statistics (independent t-test and x2). The interrelationships among the scores on the different scales and the demographic variables were investigated using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Differences in the mean scores on the CEMS and the children’s anxiety levels between the two intervention groups were assessed by an independent t-test and mixed between-within subjects ANOVA, respectively. Multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the effects of participants’ demographic and clinical characteristics on the outcome measures.\nContent analysis was adopted to analyse the semi-structured interviews. According to Weber (1990), it is one of the most objective and systematic approaches used for qualitative data analysis. With reference to the study protocol, the recordings were fully transcribed verbatim immediately after the interviews. Two research students who were not involved in data collection helped to identify different themes by examining the transcriptions line by line. All these identified themes would be further summarised as codes according to their similarities and differences. Any dialogue relevant to the codes was translated into English for reporting. The research team members resolved disagreements of the analysis during their meetings. \n34.11\tResults\nA total of 393 patients were recruited from November 2012 to October 2013. However, 89 questionnaires were found to be largely incomplete as a result of unanticipated early discharge or intra-hospital transfer. Therefore, 304 questionnaires from a total eligible pool of 393 patients were used for the analysis. Of the 304 patients, 154 received the therapeutic play intervention and 150 received usual care.\n34.11.1\tDemographic characteristics of the participants \n34.11.2\tGender distribution \nThe experimental and control groups in the two age groups contained similar numbers of boys and girls. The demographic and baseline anxiety scores for the experimental and control groups for the 3 to 7 and 8 to 12 year-old age groups are further summarised in Table 2. The results show that the experimental and control groups in the two age groups were similar with respect to the children’s ages, sex, diagnoses, number of hospital admissions, and baseline anxiety scores, suggesting a high level of comparability of variance between the experimental and control groups. \n34.12\tFactors contributing to children’s negative emotions and anxiety\nThe relationships among the scores on the different scales and the demographic variables were investigated. With reference to Cohen, correlation coefficients of 0.10 to 0.29, 0.30 to 0.49, and 0.50 to 1.0 were interpreted as small, medium, and large, respectively. The results indicated that there were statistically significant high positive correlations between the anxiety and CEMS scores of children aged 3-7 (r = .62, n = 182, p = .01) and 8-12 (r =.70, n = 122, p = .01). Furthermore, small negative correlations were found between the time of hospital admission and anxiety scores for children aged 3-7 (r = 0.26, n = 182, p < .01) and 8-12 (r 0.28, n = 122, p < .01). The results of the multiple regression analyses indicated that demographic and clinical factors, including the children’s age and gender, diagnosis and time of hospital admission, did not make a statistically significant contribution to the prediction of anxiety and CEMS scores. \n34.13\tNegative emotions of children between the experimental and control groups \nAn independent t-test showed statistically significant differences between the mean CEMS scores of children aged 3-7 in the experimental (M = 9.4, S.D. =1.9) and control groups [M = 18 \n\n \n \n12.6, S.D. =3.4; t (180) = 7.3, p < .001], and of children aged 8-12 in the experimental (M = 10.8, S.D. = 2.7) and control groups [M = 13.7, S.D. = 3.8; t (120) = 8.1, p < .001]. Children who received the therapeutic play intervention reported less negative emotional behaviour during hospitalisation. \n34.14\tAnxiety level of children between the experimental and control groups \nThe mean anxiety levels of children aged 3-7 in the experimental and control groups are illustrated in Figure 7. As shown in the figure, the mean anxiety levels of children in the experimental and control groups were more or less the same at T1. However, there was a substantial decline [2.8 points] in the mean anxiety level in the experimental group at T2, whereas the mean anxiety level of control group only slightly decreased by 0.6 points at T2.\n34.15\tQualitative interview results \n34.15.1\tChildren and their parents’ perceptions of the play intervention \nWhen the children were asked to comment on their perceptions of receiving the therapeutic play intervention in the hospital, many stated that it helped them know more about medical procedures. With such an understanding, the children said they no longer felt anxious and stressed before their medical procedures. Some examples of the children’s responses are given below. \n“I was not going to worry about venipuncture after the therapeutic play intervention. The play specialist explained the procedures to me during the intervention. I don’t get scared of syringes anymore. They can be fun, like a toy. I also made a syringe doll by myself with the help of the play specialist.” \nThe parents shared similar thoughts. Many of them stated that their children became much more settled after the intervention and some said that their children were much more courageous about having medical procedures. Some examples of their responses are given below. \n“My son became much more settled after the therapeutic play intervention. He felt much happier after playing with the play specialist.” \n“I’ve never seen my son so brave when facing medical procedures. I would like to thank the play specialist for her therapeutic play intervention.” \nBoth the children and their parents reported that their impressions of the hospital changed after the intervention. Before the intervention, many of them perceived that healthcare professionals, particularly doctors and nurses, were apathetic and not sensitive enough to patients’ psychological needs. As such, they did not feel able to ask questions during the medical procedure or the consultation. After the intervention, most of them changed their mind and said they felt the hospital cared about their psychological needs. They generally thought that the hospital play specialists were members of the hospital staff, and their good performance had a direct positive effect on the image of all healthcare professionals, thus helping to build trusting relationships between the medical staff and patients. Some examples of their responses are given below.\n“I am not afraid to see doctors now. I am able to express my feelings and ask them questions. I was startled by my last experience in another hospital because they (healthcare professionals) didn’t care what I thought. However, I wasn’t stressed this time because they (the play specialists) have been helping me to cope with the pain (caused by medical procedures).” \n“It is awesome to have emotional support from the play specialist. I feel that I am respected and cared for by the hospital.” \n34.16\tSuitability of the therapeutic play intervention \nMany of the children and their parents said they were happy to receive the therapeutic play intervention because the activities were fun and interesting. Some examples of their responses are given below.\n“I like having the therapeutic play intervention – it’s fun. I no longer feel bored and lonely after such an intervention.’\n‘It (the therapeutic play intervention) is a wonderful service for my child; I am satisfied with the activities and games because they are fun and interesting.” \nSome parents also said the teaching methods were interactive, which helped draw children’s attention to the information about standard medical procedures, which are commonly regarded as boring topics. An example of their responses is given below. \n“My son had more medical knowledge after the therapeutic play.” \nSome parents mentioned that the therapeutic play intervention provided an opportunity for their children to socialise with others. During the intervention, they could make friends with other children on the ward so that they felt less lonely. An example of their responses is given below. \n“Since the therapeutic play intervention, my daughter does not mind having to stay longer in the hospital. She made friends with the girl who was next to her and the play specialist during the intervention.” \n34.17\tNurses’ perceptions of the play intervention \nMany nurses reported that the psychological needs of hospitalised children were fulfilled after receiving hospital play intervention. \n“It is easily observed that those children who received therapeutic play intervention exhibited fewer negative emotions, such as crying during hospitalisation. Most importantly, I found that children were easily calmed down and became more cooperative during medical procedures. It’s really unbelievable!”\nNotwithstanding the fact that many nurses found hospital play intervention was effective in reducing anxiety and negative emotions for hospitalised children, some of them thought they couldn’t implement it because of the tight schedule. They hoped that more resources could be allocated by the government in future to sustain this intervention. \n“I do support having therapeutic play intervention within the hospital as it can improve the quality of care delivery and create a positive image of the hospital. Given that our workload is hefty, an insufficient workforce is a major obstacle to implementing therapeutic play in the hospital. It would be perfect if more resources, particularly staffing, can be allocated to the pediatric units for such activity.” \n34.18\tDiscussion \nThe findings of this study suggest that the Hong Kong Chinese children experienced considerable anxiety on admission to hospital. The results are consistent with previous studies that found that hospitalised children experienced different degrees of sadness, unhappiness and worry. In comparison with previous studies that have used the same scale to measure the anxiety of Hong Kong Chinese children of a similar age, the anxiety scores of children on admission to hospital in this study were similar to those of children immediately before undergoing surgery, but higher than those of school children in the pre-academic examination period. The results also showed a high positive correlation between the CSAS-C and CEMS. The findings concur with those of a previous study, in which children with high anxiety levels in the immediate pre-operative period had more negative emotional responses during the procedure for anaesthesia induction. The findings provide further evidence that anxiety hinders children’s ability to cope with hospitalisation and medical treatment, and increases negative and uncooperative behaviour toward healthcare. \nThere is an assumption that the number of hospital admissions a child experiences strongly affects his or her anxiety levels and emotional responses. Nevertheless, the multiple regression analysis results did not find statistically significant effects for the number of hospital admissions on children’s outcomes in this study. The findings suggest that hospitalisation is a stressful and threatening experience for children, regardless of whether they have had previous hospital admission experience. \nThe overall results support the effectiveness of therapeutic play in minimising the anxiety levels and negative emotions of Hong Kong Chinese children who have been hospitalised. Indeed, providing therapeutic play for children during hospitalisation has particular advantages because illness and its accompanying stress and physical restriction interrupt natural play and socialisation, which are essential for children’s normal growth and development. Most importantly, involvement in play activities during hospitalisation can improve children’s coping skills and decrease their stress, eventually leading to better psychosocial adjustment to their illness and hospitalisation. \n34.18.1\tImplementation potential of therapeutic play in clinical settings \nAlthough the overall results provide evidence that the therapeutic play intervention was effective in minimising children’s anxiety and negative emotions during hospitalisation, it is crucial to ensure that the intervention can be implemented in clinical practice. To ensure the children were able to engage in play activities, the time of implementation was flexible and the sessions were repeated at different times of the day. Participants were invited to join the play activities when they were not occupied by any medical treatments or physiological care. Therefore, it would be feasible for the healthcare system to consider incorporating therapeutic play as a routine psychological preparation for children undergoing hospitalisation. \nMost of the interviewed children reported that the therapeutic play intervention helped relieve their anxiety because they better understand their illness and the medical procedures. Most of the children were pleased to know that most of the medical or nursing procedures would not cause them any pain and would be well controlled. Most importantly, the children enjoyed the therapeutic play in the hospital and found the activities fun and interesting. \nAlthough Chinese parents have traditionally viewed play as less critical for hospitalised children than physiological care or medical treatment, most of the parents in the experimental group appreciated the availability of play activities within the hospital. Indeed, a previous study conducted in Hong Kong showed that parents were reassured by watching their children participate in play activities and interact with children. \nAll of the nurses in the interview commented that the therapeutic play effectively reduced the children’s negative emotions during hospitalisation, which gave them time to calm the children down and meant that the medical or nursing procedures could be administered more smoothly. Most of them agreed that therapeutic play should be implemented within the hospital. Most importantly, nurses believe that it creates a more positive image of the hospital and staff as a result of implementing therapeutic play interventions for hospitalised children. Nevertheless, they expressed strong concern about the extra manpower required, which needs more support from the hospital organisation. However, the shortage of nurses in Hong Kong hospitals is not just a local but a global problem. Although most nurses believe that therapeutic play can be an effective intervention for promoting the psychological well-being of hospitalised children, it is not feasible for them to spend half an hour providing play activities for each child.\nNevertheless, supporting the children to adapt to life in the hospital and face the stress of treatments is crucial. It is essential to have Hospital Play Service in paediatric wards. Using hospital play specialists (HPS) to implement therapeutic play may be one of the best solutions to the shortage of nurses. Most hospitals in Australia, the United States, and other Western countries employ HPS, who play an important role in promoting psychological care for hospitalised children through the provision of play activities. Although it may require some extra resources in the short term, it would certainly enhance hospitals’ capacity to promote better health in the long run. Indeed, it only takes about half an hour a day to provide a creative recreational and psychosocial intervention to make a child’s hospitalisation less difficult. Clearly, it would be economically feasible for the healthcare system to consider and implement this intervention as a routine practice for hospitalised children.\n34.19\tLimitations \nThere are some limitations of this study. First, although a randomised controlled trial is the most powerful approach for testing cause-and-effect relationships between independent and dependent variables, we could not randomise individual patients within a paediatric unit in a hospital because there was a possibility of contamination between different treatment groups within the setting, and because some children and their parents might have been concerned if they were aware that they were experiencing a different form of intervention. Therefore, a non-equivalent control group design was used. Second, the use of convenience sampling and therapeutic play intervention was only implemented in one setting, thus limiting the generalisability of the results. Third, this study only observed children’s anxiety levels and emotional responses on two consecutive days, which may not have been long enough to fully assess hospitalisation’s effect on the children’s psychological well-being. Nevertheless, as short-stay hospitalisation is recommended in today’s healthcare policy, many hospitalised children will be discharged home after 1 to 3 days.\n34.20\tPractice implications \nThe findings of the study generate new knowledge and evidence about therapeutic play with major clinical implications. The results emphasise the importance of integrating therapeutic play as an essential component of holistic and high-quality care to ease the psychological burden of hospitalised children. It also promotes the awareness in healthcare professionals and parents that play is a very important part of children’s life, and that they need play even when they are ill. Indeed, play is instinctive, voluntary, and spontaneous; children play just as birds fly and fish swim. We believe the therapeutic play intervention can be applied to all children regardless of their cultural backgrounds or settings. Given the importance of play to children’s psychological health, it is recommended that the hospital authority should advocate the importance of play for hospitalised children by providing more resources to establish more space and facilitates for children to play. Most importantly, it is crucial to employ hospital play specialists to facilitate the integration of therapeutic play into routine care for hospitalised children. \n34.21\tConclusion\nNotwithstanding the potential limitations, this study has addressed a gap in the literature by examining the effects of a therapeutic play intervention on the outcomes of hospitalised children. The most important contribution of this study is the empirical evidence it provides to support the effectiveness of therapeutic play intervention in minimising the anxiety and negative emotions of hospitalised children.\n"}]}
