Pomocí NLP vytvoř zadání pro napsání nového článku ve stejném stylu, hlase a tónu:\nEnergetické úspory ve firmách\nFirmy jsou postiženy drahými energiemi stejně jako domácnosti a na jejich ekonomiku to má zásadní dopad. Nejčastěji na zvýšené náklady podniky reagují investicemi do úsporných opatření. Jaká nejčastěji zavádějí a jak tyto změny fungují?\nPodle dat ČSÚ se domácnosti v roce 2020 podílely na odběru elektřiny z 28 %. Největší spotřebu zaznamenal energeticky náročný sektor průmyslu (přes 40 %). Ostatní odvětví pak absorbovala necelou třetinu celkové republikové spotřeby (31,6 %). Z dat je zřejmé, že na firmy dopadají drahé energie obzvlášť tíživě. Průzkum Svazu průmyslu a dopravy ze září 2022 navíc ukázal, že jen asi pětina z nich má na rok 2023 zafixované ceny elektřiny a plynu. Na většinu českých podniků proto vysoké náklady na energie zřejmě teprve dopadnou.\nChce-li se firma alespoň částečně zbavit závislosti na nevyzpytatelných tržních cenách energie, nabízí se řešení v podobě vlastní fotovoltaické elektrárny. Tato alespoň částečná soběstačnost pochopitelně láká řadu českých podniků. Na pořízení se podle zmíněného průzkumu Svazu průmyslu a dopravy chystalo téměř 60 % z nich. (Zdroj: PRAM Consulting)\nÚspory a vyšší efektivita\nV reakci na stoupající výdaje se tak firmy snaží co nejvíce šetřit. Zdaleka nejčastějším opatřením jsou investice do úsporných řešení. „V reakci na vysoké ceny energií jsme provedli hned několik úsporných investic. V první řadě jsme vyměnili starší zdroje elektrických zařízení za jiné, efektivnější. Týkalo se to zejména svítidel, výměna klasických zářivek za nové LED panely nám snížila spotřebu energie na polovinu. Osvětlení jsme proto vyměnili v podstatě všude – ve skladech, v administrativních prostorách i u venkovního osvětlení,“ popisuje Josef Durna, vedoucí správy poboček ze společnosti Gumex, která se zabývá výrobou průmyslových hadic a těsnění či servisem dopravníkových pásů. \nVyšší efektivita a šetrnost se týkají také samotného provozu. Firmy zvažují, kdy je (a kdy naopak není) nutné svítit a topit, více si hlídají též plýtvání. „Ve skladu a v méně frekventovaných společných prostorách, jako jsou chodby či sociální zařízení, jsme instalovali pohybová čidla. Díky tomu zde svítíme pouze tehdy, když je to skutečně třeba,“ říká Josef Durna. Otázku udržení tepla v místech, kde je to potřeba, mohou podniky vyřešit i speciálními závěsnými fóliemi, které se umisťují do průchodů a vrat. „Toto jednoduché řešení jsme nasadili do všech našich poboček. Pruhové závěsy z měkčeného PVC slouží nejen jako účinný izolant tepla, ale také jako protiprůvanová clona,“ doplňuje Durna. \n„Rostoucí ceny nemůžeme ovlivnit, ale vlastní zdroj elektřiny ano. Proto jsme investovali do fotovoltaické elektrárny o výkonu 50 kW a bateriových úložišť s kapacitou 44 kW. Obojí se chystáme letos na jaře dále rozšířit – elektrárnu až na výkon 80 kW, baterie na kapacitu 77 kW. Díky této investici bychom v době dlouhého denního osvitu dokázali být soběstační ve dne a částečně i v noci. Dokonce existuje varianta, že bychom nespotřebovanou energii prodávali zpět do distribuční sítě,“ vysvětluje Josef Durna a doplňuje: „Potřeba nových investic, růst výroby a výkyvy v dodavatelských cenách způsobují, že je poměrně těžké přesně spočítat úspory, které nám opatření přinesla. Nicméně odhadujeme, že v tuto chvíli ušetříme přibližně 25–30 % elektrické energie ze sítě a s plánovaným rozšířením fotovoltaické elektrárny bude úspora ještě vyšší.“ (Zdroj: PRAM Consulting)"}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Selling on YouTube is easy with Cafe24\n\nAfter Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, the e-commerce ecosystem centered around Cafe24 has now expanded its reach to YouTube. The social media powerhouse, with more than 2.24 billion users as of last year, is now open to showcase and sell products from Cafe24 stores on YouTube.\n\nWhile any cafe24 customer can already market their brand or products online by posting advertisements on YouTube, the new feature is different in that it allows them to provide product information at the bottom of live broadcasts, pre-produced videos, and uploaded videos, along with a separate category called \"Store\" for viewers who visit their YouTube channel. This provides an environment for more active communication with viewers, who can be called potential customers, centered on products.\n\nIt is more significant that Cafe24 is the first Korean e-commerce platform to introduce this feature after Shopify in the North American market. Let's take a closer look at what Cafe24 shop owners can do on their YouTube channel and the expected effects.\n\nYouTube is making e-commerce easier\n\"We want to make it easier for creators to connect and manage their own stores on YouTube and offer products directly to their audience.\"\n\nDavid Katz, VP of YouTube Shopping Products\nUntil now, it's been difficult for creators with YouTube channels to showcase and sell products they've created, collaborated with, or outsourced from outside companies. Other than adding a link to their shopping cart in the \"more\" section at the bottom of their video content or in a sticky comment section for announcements, there's been no way to turn viewers into buyers.\nRecognizing this, in July, YouTube began to provide more convenient ways for viewers to see what creators are selling when they visit a YouTube channel. For example, while live broadcasting to interact with viewers on their channel, creators can pin photos, prices, and links to their products to the top of the live chat window.\n\nThey can similarly pin product information within the viewing screen of uploaded video content to encourage purchases. It's also worth noting that in the store on their YouTube channel, they've organized the various products they carry into a single catalog, so you can see what they have to offer at a glance.\n\nViewers = potential customers, viewing and purchasing Cafe24 products on the YouTube channel\nCafe24 has made it possible for you to utilize these features without going into the YouTube settings page, and with just a few clicks from the Cafe24 shop admin page. After completing the necessary settings for the integration through the 'Google Channel' app, which provides Google's advertising and marketing features, you can use the YouTube Shopping feature.\n\nThe store category created on the YouTube channel can be updated regularly with product photos, pricing information, and product information in the shopping mall to reflect out-of-stock status, just like Facebook Shops, which Cafe24 currently supports. This is also supported for YouTube Live broadcasts and product information pinned to the bottom of the video.\n\nThis allows Cafe24 shop owners to utilize YouTube's social media giant to find new customers and communicate their brand and product information in a more engaging way. Another advantage is that there are no fees for live broadcasts using their own online malls instead of external platforms. From next year, these features will also be available in markets such as Japan and Vietnam, where Cafe24 is present.\n\nImage replacement after the service opens\nHowever, YouTube's current policy requires domestic customers to meet additional requirements, such as having more than 1,000 subscribers, 4,000 hours of public video viewing time in the past year, and a Google Merchant Center account that allows you to import store and product information to Google .\n\nAt Cafecafe24, we're proud to be a partner to help our creative customers succeed, and it's great to see our efforts translate into collaborations with a global market leader like YouTube.\n\nThe Café24-YouTube collaboration will continue in the future to make e-commerce easy and accessible for both YouTubers and shop owners and their subscribers and potential customers. We'll keep you updated on any further developments.\n\n📚References\nReady, Set, Shop on YouTube\nGetting started with YouTube Shopping\n\nWith reference to the above, write a 100% unique, creative and Human-written article in English for the Keyword \"Selling on YouTube is easy with Cafe24\". The article should include Creative Title (should be in H1 Heading), SEO meta description, Introduction, headings (Should be h2 heading), sub headings (h3, h4,h5,h6 headings), bullet points or Numbered list (if needed) , FAQs and conclusions. Make sure the article is plagiarism free. The minimum length of the article should be 1600 words long. Don't forget to use question mark (?) at the end of questions. Try not to change the original Selling on YouTube is easy with Cafe24 while writing the Title. Try to use The \"Selling on YouTube is easy with Cafe24\" 2-3 times in article. try to include Selling on YouTube is easy with Cafe24 in headings as well. write a content which can easily pass ai detection tools test.\n\nPlease write in informal tone, conversational writing style.\n\nPlease write in English language.\n    \n        \n            \n                지금 번역하기\n            \n        \n    \n"}]}

By minimizing waste and optimizing productivity, DAS can help reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. Through a simple booking process, DAS provides an allocation of resources that meets the needs of the user.\n\n \n\n\nScope/Targets\nWhen allocating resources, it is essential to have clear objectives that the system should strive to achieve. These objectives can range from minimizing the number of movements in and out of lanes, reducing the amount of car park space used, and minimizing the number of driver trips, to maximizing efficiency when parking and pulling from lanes, minimizing the distance drivers walk, and reducing the time taken from block park to departures. However, different operations will have different priorities when it comes to these objectives. Therefore, DAS should come with a customizable settings page that allows users to prioritize their targets according to their specific needs. This settings page should be independent per operation as large car parks with few staff will have different requirements than small car parks with many staff. The target must be clear and unambiguous in order for it to be properly implemented. For example, if the target is to reduce driving time between block park and departures, then a prerequisite would be knowing the coordinates of the lanes or car park layout so that an efficient solution can be calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\nIn order for DAS to meet its targets, there are several factors that need to be taken into consideration. The settings page should be used to determine which data is necessary for DAS to function properly on a given dataset. This includes, but is not limited to: \n•\tBookings Return Date\n•\tBookings Return Terminal\n•\tSize of Block Park Area(s)\n•\tSize of Lanes\n•\tSize of Departures Area(s)\n•\tSpeciality Area(s) (Valet Zones, EV Zones, Undercover Zones, Extra Long or Extra Wide Vehicles etc.)\n•\tLocations of Lanes, Entrances &amp; Exits to Block Park and Entrances &amp; Exits to Departures (for calculating distances between Lanes themselves, and lanes to departures)\n•\tStaff Availability\n•\tStaff Shift Times\n•\tAvailability of Lanes / Zones (e.g. are Some Zones only available in Summer?)\n•\tMulti Terminal Lanes\n•\tHow far in advance we are looking for similar arrivals (+ Maximum time before we close &amp; audit a lane)\nThe system should be customizable in terms of which data sets will be available for DAS to use.\n\nSegments\nDAS Segments are a key component of allocation. The system can be configured as either Flexible or Fixed segments. Fixed Segments are a more restrictive approach, where pre-selected times of the day are manually input. The current KMOS segment editor could be expanded to include different segments depending on the day, allowing DAS to function similarly to KMOS without the need for a Key Master. Flexible Segments offer more potential but also more complexity. This approach allows DAS to look ahead at predicted arrivals and departures, combine this data with its targets, and determine its set of segment times per individual day of the year. The more data sets available, the more efficient this approach will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\nOnce DAS has a set of targets and knows the data sets that will be available at point of allocation you can then configure the algorithm that’ll be used to calculate the final allocation. This is the complex bit so that when you feed DAS a booking (or set of bookings) it follows the algorithm step by step until it produces the allocation.\nAn example would be something like the below\n\n \n\n\nOther factors to consider are Manual Overrides (the ability to allow intervention by a User to change lane allocations). Recalculations (after a day has passed, Non Arrivals / Overstays may mean there is now more or less space available than expected). Unexpected Events; an Incident (e.g. a crash) could cause a temporary lane closure that may affect future allocations for a period. \n\nFinally DAS should also be periodically reviewed, either manually or by itself to look for improvements. Particularly in the case when there is a limited set of data to begin with. After a period of operation it should be able to detect certain information with greater accuracy (such as weekly trends &amp; seasonal trends). It could then suggest possible changes to the algorithm which if taken into account could lead to more efficiencies.\n\nOverall, DAS is a powerful tool that can be used to automate the allocation of resources in a variety of scenarios. With the right configuration and data sets it can be used to make decisions quickly and accurately, saving time and money.\n"}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Carbon emissions trading operates on the basis of the cap-and-trade principle, which sets a cap on the total amount of carbon emissions allowed within a specific period. This cap is then divided into permits that can be traded among companies that emit carbon. Companies that can reduce emissions below the allocated level can sell unused permits to companies that cannot do so, creating a market-based incentive for emissions reductions. Cap-and-trade schemes are designed to create market-driven incentives for companies to invest in green technologies and reduce carbon emissions. In the context of the renewable energy industry, carbon emissions trading can encourage investment in clean energy as companies seek to reduce carbon emissions and obtain licenses for future transactions.\nCarbon pricing mechanisms, including carbon trading schemes, can play a key role in attracting private investment in the renewable energy sector, which is critical to meeting global climate goals, according to a World Bank report. The report states that “carbon pricing is an effective tool to guide capital for low-carbon investment, incentivize technological innovation, and help reduce emissions in the most cost-effective manner.” Carbon trading creates opportunities for companies to reduce carbon emissions by allowing them to sell unused allowances. This creates financial incentives, which in turn reduces the overall cost of abatement and promotes more efficient resource allocation.\nThe success of carbon trading schemes depends on a variety of factors, such as the initial allocation of emission allowances, the stability of carbon prices, and the effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. A study by the International Monetary Fund found that \"well-designed carbon pricing systems can help governments generate revenue, encourage private sector investment in clean technologies, and help address climate change in a cost-effective manner.\" The study also noted that carbon pricing schemes It can help countries meet their climate goals, such as those set out in the Paris Agreement, and foster international cooperation on climate change."}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "how does this sound for my internal audit interview. you can pucket it up if you must: The audit found that the Clifton Park site's management of external providers was compliant with Clause 8.4 and the SOPs aligned with ISO, with no major findings or areas for improvement identified. The site's evaluation and selection of external providers were based on documented selection criteria, supply constraints, and testing processes. Non-critical suppliers did not require a quality agreement, and their requirements were communicated through initial communications and necessary documents.\n\nThe site established controls for external providers based on the impact of their ability to meet customer requirements. Critical suppliers underwent on-site audits, and incoming inspections were used to establish controls. Supplier performance was monitored and measured through scorecards, and non-conformities were addressed through NCMRs and supplier corrective actions. The audit found documented evidence of management of external providers, including vendor questionnaires, supplier evaluations, and scorecards.\n\nTwo external providers, Beaver and Airborne Testing Spider, were reviewed for their compliance status. Beaver had completed their questionnaire and on-site audit without findings, while Airborne Testing Spider was rated as critical and had completed their evaluation form and was ISO certified.\n\nThe site made updates and improvements to its supplier management program, including adopting a global procedure and transferring multiple suppliers to the global Approved Supplier List to eliminate redundant on-site audits and better manage suppliers with multiple sites.\n\nMinor issues were identified, such as errors in data entry for a supplier scorecard and inaccuracies in some definitions in the SOP compared to the Global purchasing procedure. The Purchasing and Supply Management SOPs were reviewed and found to need updating to align with SAP and remove unnecessary information.\n\nDuring the audit, a deviation from the SOP was identified where meeting minutes of the Annual Supplier Review Meeting were not taken as outlined in the procedure. The deviation has been addressed, and corrective action taken to determine if meeting minutes are a requirement and done by other Repligen sites. Additionally, discrepancies were identified in the attachments section of the SOP-033, where they did not align with the section numbering in the SOP.\n\nOverall, the audit found that the Clifton Park site had effective controls and monitoring in place for external providers. However, there were minor issues identified that were addressed, and the site made improvements to its supplier management program to ensure continued compliance with ISO standards.   400 words   2760 char  Copy Text  Copy HTML   Export PDF   Text-Speech   Plagiarism Checker   Search Trend   Bulgarian   Chinese   Czech   Danish   Dutch   English (US)   English (UK)   Estonian   Finnish   French   German   Greek   Hungarian   Indonesian   Italian   Japanese   Latvian   Lithuanian   Polish   Portuguese    Portuguese (BZ)   Romanian   Russian   Slovak   Slovenian   Spanish   Swedish   Turkish   UkrainianCopy to Clipboard \n    \n    \n  copycopycopycopycopy"}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "The following is the interview response of the beauty brand CEO, Ardman. Please create Instagram content that highlights your achievements based on the information below. Please separate the article into three parts. Suggest suitable titles, emoticons, and hashtags.\n\n\n1) Brand name meaning\nAdman is French. It means see you tomorrow. It means to look forward to new changes with excitement, looking forward to tomorrow as well as today.\n\n2) Start-up opportunity\nCEO Kim Yong-hyeok (born in 1990) graduated from the Department of Venture Management at Seoul National University. Since he was in college, he has been interested in entrepreneurship. While working for a company (working at SK Planet in service planning and strategic planning), he thought that it would be impossible to start a business unless it was now, so he quit writing for the company. He first started with a brand business and is now preparing for several businesses.\n\n3) Growth history\nIn January 2023, skincare brand ‘A’demang’ joined hands with beauty creator ‘Arang’, which has 350,000 subscribers, to conduct ‘live broadcasting (Labang)’ on YouTube. In particular, the 'Arang X Adman Encore 2nd Market' package products, which can only be met during this collaboration period, are organized and introduced, and the purchase certification, review posting events, etc. are held to attract viewers' response, while the chat window in Labang displays purchase certification. and product-related inquiries continued uninterrupted.\nIn fact, 20,000 viewers flocked to this Labang in one day, and from 7 pm on the day of the broadcast to the next day (29 hours in total), sales exceeded 150 million won, so it was a box office success. This is an achievement achieved in just three weeks after building a D2C (Direct to Consumer) shopping mall.\n\n4) Product/Brand Introduction\nArdman's first product is a toner pad. It was born with the meaning of creating a skin that is expected every day. People need care not only for their skin type but also for their skin condition. Therefore, it was produced with the intention of conditioning the skin that is suitable for oneself by considering the condition of the skin.\n\n5) Product/Brand Differentiation\nThe difference between toner pads is that they are large, soft in texture, and contain a lot of essence. The larger size was made in response to the opinions of consumers who use toner pads instead of packs. Normally, 2-3 toner pads are used to use as a pack, but one Aardman product is sufficient.\n\nToner pad and ampoule products have been vegan certified. Both products use Houttuynia cordata ingredients to have soothing and moisturizing effects, and received a green rating from the EWG, an American non-profit environmental research organization, which certifies that they have the lowest harmful ingredients, and were recognized as free from harmful ingredients by the beauty platform Hwahae.\n\nAlso, Ardman's cosmetics use a lot of good raw materials even if the cost is high. For example, purified water was not used in the ampoule.\n\n6) Sales (Marketing) Strategy\nCollaborate with multiple creators to launch products. The first collaboration was with Arang Creator. In addition, we plan to collaborate with several mega influencers. The reason I work with creators is because they are experts. For example, Arang is the best expert in cosmetics. Arang clearly pointed out what kind of needs there are when developing products and what elements need to be developed to meet those needs.\n\n11) Reasons for choosing Cafe24\nAfter doing online business centered on open markets such as Smart Store and Coupang, they built D2C (own mall) 2-3 weeks ago. The strength of jasamol becomes a real customer when consumers buy. When selling on other platforms, consumers stop buying products, but in D2C, it is possible to provide customized benefits or services according to the customer's inclination. Therefore, it is expected that sales can be increased through D2C.\n    \n        \n            \n                지금 번역하기\n            \n        \n    \n"}]}

My content there has been viewed by over 1.7M people. And it's unlikely I'll ever write anything there again. \n\nWhich may be a much bigger problem than it seems. Because it may be the canary in the mine of our collective knowledge. \n\nA canary that signals a change in the airflow of knowledge: from human-human via machine, to human-machine only. Don’t pass human, don’t collect 200 virtual internet points along the way.\n\nStackOverflow is *the* repository for programming Q&amp;A. It has 100M users &amp; saves man-years of time &amp; wig-factories-worth of grey hair every single day. \n\nIt is driven by people like me who ask questions that other developers answer. Or vice-versa. Over 10 years I've asked 217 questions &amp; answered 77. Those questions have been read by millions of developers &amp; had tens of millions of views.\n\nBut since GPT4 it looks less &amp; less likely any of that will happen; at least for me. Which will be bad for StackOverflow. But if I'm representative of other knowledge-workers then it presents a larger &amp; more alarming problem for us as humans. \n\nWhat happens when we stop pooling our knowledge with each other &amp; instead pour it straight into The Machine? Where will our libraries be? How can we avoid total dependency on The Machine? What content do we even feed the next version of The Machine to train on? \n\nWhen it comes time to train GPTx it risks drinking from a dry riverbed. Because programmers won't be asking many questions on StackOverflow. GPT4 will have answered them in private. So while GPT4 was trained on all of the questions asked before 2021 what will GPT6 train on? \n\nThis raises a more profound question. If this pattern replicates elsewhere &amp; the direction of our collective knowledge alters from outward to humanity to inward into the machine then we are dependent on it in a way that supercedes all of our prior machine-dependencies. \n\nWhether or not it \"wants\" to take over, the change in the nature of where information goes will mean that it takes over by default. \n\nLike a fast-growing Covid variant, AI will become the dominant source of knowledge simply by virtue of growth. If we take the example of StackOverflow, that pool of human knowledge that used to belong to us - may be reduced down to a mere weighting inside the transformer. \n\nOr, perhaps even more alarmingly, if we trust that the current GPT doesn't learn from its inputs, it may be lost altogether. Because if it doesn't remember what we talk about &amp; we don't share it then where does the knowledge even go?\n\nWe already have an irreversible dependency on machines to store our knowledge. But at least we control it. We can extract it, duplicate it, go &amp; store it in a vault in the Arctic (as Github has done). \n\nSo what happens next? I don't know, I only have questions. \n\nNone of which you'll find on StackOverflow.\n\n(I write on AI from a technical and product perspective.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "keep these two sections but rewrite to remove redundancies:\n\n\n2. Team and Organizational Update \n\n \nThe past few months were challenging as we spent an unexpected amount of time fixing breakages in unfamiliar systems and felt the loss of our departed colleagues. Despite these difficulties, we successfully delivered on our business goals achieving +16.88% iOPS vs OP2, +35.11% net CCP vs OP2. For OP2, we focused on the LP “invent and simplify” to maintain customer obsession as we rebuilt our roadmap. We pooled engineering resources between Paid and Earned to avoid being constrained by preassigned org structure, and selected initiatives that were best for Amazon across both teams. Rather than just drawing a new cutline based on fewer resources (which could have significantly reduced morale), we analyzed each initiative line-by-line and task-by-task, exploring creative solutions with partner teams to combine forces or make ownership adjustments to pick up items falling BTL.\n\n \n\nOne highlight is our collaboration with Social that leverages their loaned headcount to provide TMT customers off-Amazon with the best offerings and most accurate representation of Amazon’s catalog through Data Subscription Service. This service improves the fidelity and accuracy of ASIN attribute data while making access to core advertising product attributes easy for new opportunities to experiment and launch.  \n\n \n\nThe new roadmap led to the reallocation of projects and the shifting of SDEs. For instance, the CN engineering team expanded their scope from supporting only the SEO pipeline to owning Paid initiatives and the Experimentation systems. While the overall PM/engineering management structure remains unchanged, several engineering teams have adopted new charters that will continue to be relevant in the years ahead. \n\n \n\nDespite these improvements, only 22% of our roadmap is dedicated to growth initiatives with 33% of our engineering resources allocated to KTLO and 45% allocated to OE. It was disappointing to cut $389 MM net CCP in projects with approved specs and dedicated owners, but through this process we remained focused on creative problem solving, earned trust, and grew closer as a team. \n\n\n4. 2023 Overview \n\n \nIn 2023, we remain dedicated to investing in our long-term vision as outlined in our 3YP. We started with the most business critical projects when drafting our roadmap causing 78% of our engineering resources to be largely dedicated to objective two of our 3YP: “Minimize overhead while developing flexible, resilient software architecture that supports Search Marketing.” These technical investments are 33% KTLO and 45% OE, with our OE initiatives deemed essential re-architecture efforts to reduce the cost to serve and streamline initiatives. Several of our engineering projects nearly pay themselves off in the first year of effort: Project Kondo’s 2023 investment costs 15 eng weeks, but saves us 33 weeks of legacy upkeep and with additional work next year, it is expected to unlock $290M CCP in three years. In addition, Search Marketing Toolkit’s Hydra Migration costs us 70 weeks, but saves 30 weeks in year one and 110 weeks by year three. \n\n \n\nFollowing these must-have investments, the remaining 22% of our roadmap is allocated to ensuring investment in our critical projects, such as Marketing Context Service (MCS) and the integration of Optimal Inventory Health (OIH) signals into our bidder. Through repeated emphasis on invent and simplify, we continue to have the ability to invest in other critical areas of our 3YP such as Experimentation and Profitability, and we are looking for creative solutions to continue progress in BTL items (accounting for $389M CCP) by utilizing an away-team model.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "I have a company founded in colombia on march 2022. In the begining there were 3 co-founders and i payed in october 2022 an amount that was equivalent to 25% of the company. The company is named Celes. Celes is a SaaS B2B that connects to an ERP, analyzes the data and gives recommendations about what to purchases and when, besides, it provides helpful business intelligence reports and customer segmentation. Celes serves companies in the retail sector that benefit from this services as they can have lower stocks and a lower expectation of lost sales. \nThe company has been growing and currently we have 30.000 USD in MRR, an average 1000 USD revenue per client, 12 employees, we pay low salaries compared to the industry and we are not burning money (the incompe received is enough to pay for our current costs of servers, admin and payroll).\nWe are raising money to accelerate our growth and to increase the value provided by our product by hiring more developers, Technical Account Managers and Data Engineers. We expecto to raise $800.000 USD via SAFE from angles and institutional investors with a pre-money cap of $6.0000.000 USD. All this money will be received by a new c-corp company established in Delaware, US.\nWe contacted a company in ireland named Primeline that is a provider to 100% of the biggest retailers in ireland and have a very close relationship with them. They love our product and became a customer of their own.\nPrimeline proposed to invest 300.000 USD via SAFE on the terms that we are raising and were previously exposed. FOr this investment they are asking for a seat in oour board. Apart from that, we are working in a deal where we create a Joint Venture established in ireland called Primalytics. The owners of this Joint Venture will be Primeline (50%) AND Celes Delaware (50%). The purpose of this Joint Venture is to be the official seller of Celes in ireland where Celes Delaware provides the product and everything involved and Primeline will contact its clients so that they purchase Celes services via this JV.\nThe initial proposal was that the 2 companies would split the net revenue of this JV (Revenue after admin and fiscal costs are covered). I think that this deal is advantageous for primeline given that Celes will do all the work and Primeline has nothing to lose from this partnership but the average client in ireland would be at least 4.000 USD, which would provide a nice additional source of revenue for us even when we have to give 50% of the revenue for those deals and also would make the company more valueable given that the product would be proven to work in europe with big brands.\nNow primeline is proposing this:\n\n\"Primeline commits to Investment USD 300k into the Celes Delaware investment company directly. This investment to be returned to the Primalytics JV in Ireland to fund a sales and marketing team focused on growing ARR from EMEA. This represents 5% share in the business and would come with a board seat focused on growing the business.\nWe confirm a vesting vehicle that allows for 50% of the ARR generated out of the Primalytics JV to convert to Equity in Celes based on a 15 times ARR multiple. If Celes is sold for 20 times multiple Primeline’s 50% share of JV sales would convert at 15 times. If Celes is sold at below 15 times then Primeline would match the lower than 15 times multiple for conversion to shares.\nWe believe the focus on selling Celes in Europe and EMEA through the Irish JV will drive significant ARR value quickly.\nWe believe our extensive network into retailers and brands uniquely positions us to drive Celes ARR to USD 1m plus from EMEA.\"\n\nI dont think this is fair because i understand that they will increase the value of their 300kUSD investment inn Celes Delawere when the company sells more and additionally, each dollar sold in Ireland would give them more and more participation in the company. I might be wrong but i think this will give them a double winning while we are the ones doing all the work.\n\nThe co-founder leading the negotiation is proposing this:\n\n\"50% of the revenue from the JV, will be converted to equity at the series A valuation with a 20% discount. That would be like making a SAFE with a cap and discount that is typical from YCombinator\".\n\nI think it might be a sound counter proposal but i am not sure if it would give primeline an over advantageous benefit compared to standard or commom practices in this regard. I would very much like to have the JV with them because it would increase our revenue and the valuation of the company. I think Primeline is fundamental to enter that market. My way to defend this proposal is thinking we will receive capital in the way of the revenue that would otherwise go to Primeline and we will use that money before the series A, so giving additional equity for that money could be fair and the discount will recognize the decrease in value of that money at the time of the series A.\n\nPlease provide a proposal that will make primeline and me very confortable given the context provided. Please ask as many questions as you need about what you need to know to provide a comprehensive answer."}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Microsoft wil 10 miljard dollar betalen voor 49 procent van ChatGPT-maker'\nMicrosoft zou 10 miljard dollar willen investeren in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI en zou 49 procent van diens aandelen willen. De investering zou gepaard gaan met andere investeerders, die eveneens 49 procent van OpenAI in handen zouden krijgen.\n\nOpenAI en Microsoft zijn volgens Semafor-bronnen de afgelopen weken in gesprek geweest over de investering, waarbij Microsoft 75 procent van OpenAI's winst zou krijgen tot het bedrijf zijn investering terug heeft verdiend. Daarna zou Microsoft 49 procent van OpenAI in handen hebben en andere investeerders 49 procent. Een non-profit zou dan de resterende 2 procent van OpenAI houden.\n\nMet de investering zou OpenAI gewaardeerd worden op 29 miljard dollar. Eerder zeiden Wall Street Journal-bronnen al dat investeringsbedrijven Thrive Capital en Founders Fund interesse hadden in een deel van OpenAI, waarbij eveneens een waardering van 29 miljard dollar werd genoemd. Die krant schreef in oktober al dat Microsoft in gesprek was om een groter deel van OpenAI in handen te kunnen krijgen.\n\nMicrosoft en OpenAI zijn geen onbekenden van elkaar: in 2019 investeerde het bedrijf al een miljard dollar in OpenAI. Daarnaast zeiden The Information-bronnen onlangs dat Microsoft ChatGPT wil integreren in Word, PowerPoint, Outlook en Bing. Microsoft en OpenAI wilden niet reageren op de deal. OpenAI bracht in november een publieke versie uit van AI-gesprekstool ChatGPT.  SI dit een goede deal voor Microsoft?Het is moeilijk om te zeggen of dit een goede deal voor Microsoft is zonder meer informatie te hebben over de specifieke details van de deal.\nMaar als we algemene kijk op de situatie nemen:OpenAI is een bedrijf dat zich richt op onderzoek en ontwikkeling van kunstmatige intelligentie (AI) en heeft een aantal toonaangevende technologieën zoals GPT-3 (de ChatGPT-maker genoemd in de bericht)Microsoft heeft al eerder geïnvesteerd in OpenAI en heeft kennis van het bedrijf, dus het is waarschijnlijk dat ze vertrouwd zijn met de waardevoorstelling van OpenAI.Een investering van $10 miljard voor 49% van het bedrijf, zou een waardering van $20 miljard dollar voor OpenAI weergeven. Dit is redelijk significant bedrag voor een bedrijf dat zich richt op AI-onderzoek, en zou aangeven dat Microsoft de waarde van de technologieën van OpenAI inziet.Daarom, als Microsoft in staat is om de technologieën van OpenAI efficiënt te integreren in hun bestaande producten en oplossingen, en er een goed rendement op hun investering komt, zou het kunnen zijn een goede deal voor hen.Het is belangrijk te realiseren dat dit slechts geruchten zijn en er geen officiële bevestiging is van het bericht. Beide bedrijven hebben geweigerd om te reageren.GPT-3 maaklt gebruik van Microsoft Azure SaaS en ChatGPT cponsumeert nu per dag 3 miljoed dollar. Wat vindt je daarvan Het feit dat GPT-3 maakt gebruik van Microsoft Azure SaaS, suggereert dat er een nauwe samenwerking bestaat tussen OpenAI en Microsoft, en dat Microsofts cloud-oplossing een belangrijk onderdeel is van hoe GPT-3 wordt gehost en geleverd.Het consumptiebedrag van 3 miljoen dollar per dag voor ChatGPT, suggereert dat er een groot volume aan verzoeken is naar de service, en dat ChatGPT een populaire en waardevolle aanvulling is op het productaanbod van OpenAI. Het feit dat ChatGPT zo'n hoog kostenbedrag heeft, kan ook suggereren dat er een hoge vraag naar de service is van zakelijke klanten en dat de service waarschijnlijk een aantrekkelijke inkomstenbron is voor OpenAI.Als het bedrijf Microsoft 49% van OpenAI zou verkrijgen, zou dit een grote boost betekenen voor OpenAI, in termen van financiering, technologie en marktbereik, dit zou betekenen dat de technologieën van OpenAI zullen kunnen worden geïntegreerd in de producten en oplossingen van Microsoft, waardoor de aantrekkingskracht van de service vergroot zal worden voor nog meer bedrijven.Echter, het is belangrijk om te realiseren dat het consumptiebedrag van 3 miljoen dollar per dag voor ChatGPT slechts geruchten zijn, zonder officiële bevestiging is het lastig om te zeggen of dit daadwerkelijk het geval is.de gebruikerc van ChatGPT betalen nu in de meeste gevallen (nog) niets.Het is inderdaad waarschijnlijk dat de meeste gebruikers van ChatGPT op dit moment geen directe kosten betalen voor de service. Dit komt omdat OpenAI ChatGPT momenteel aanbiedt als een \"open access\" service, waarbij iedereen gratis toegang heeft tot de technologie. Dit is een gebruikelijke manier waarop AI-bedrijven hun technologieën ontwikkelen en testen, voordat ze commercieel beschikbaar zijn gemaakt.Echter, als de veronderstelling waar is dat ChatGPT nu per dag 3 miljoen dollar kost, is het goed mogelijk dat OpenAI plannen heeft om de technologie commercieel beschikbaar te maken en inkomsten te genereren uit de service. Dit kan bijvoorbeeld door middel van prijsmodellen voor hogere volumes aan verzoeken of specifieke functies, of door middel van enterprise licenties voor bedrijven die de technologie willen integreren in hun eigen producten of oplossingen.Het is belangrijk om te realiseren dat dit allemaal speculatie is, gebaseerd op geruchten en zonder officiële bevestiging van OpenAI over hun plannen voor ChatGPT. OpenAI zou zich hierover willen uitlaten als ze dat willen."}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please compose a pitch deck of eight to fifteen slides for my company, Cortado, based on the following outline:\n************************Intro / Hook************************\n\nMy name is [ FNAME ], and over the last X months my partner and I took a real estate company from launch to more than $350,000 in revenue by leveraging new AI tools to target an $71 trillion niche housing market.\n\nHow have we taken Cortado to this point? We utilized a tried-and-true rental arbitrage model to  target a deeply undersupplied housing market, while leveraging a suite of AI-powered tools to quickly scale our MVP; acquiring, marketing and managing all Cortado inventory without a single new hire.\n\n- In 10 months, we’ve taken Cortado from $0 to $350,000 in revenue by leveraging low-cost AI tools to target a massive niche housing market: international student housing.\n\n**********************Market Size**********************\n\nWhat is this niche market? International student housing, an undersupplied subset of the growing MTR market.\n\n- 6+ million students per year (8m by 2025)\n- 5.5% growth over the last 20 years, even through COVID (4.28% growth from 2019-2020)\n- Total Available Market (TAM) of $71 trillion\n    - $214 per week average ([source](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1cwVYQgmUBjj_FjMlpHg4Ru01K7bRY_Bq))\n    - 6,361,963 international students in 2020 ([source](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ft1EJsDua-FjUPVw-gegaX5t6coQVYzz9ghe6wNGVZ8/edit#gid=1422332990))\n        - TAM = ((weekly avg/7)*365)*#int’l students\n    - Doesn’t include domestic exchange or additional MTR verticals (traveling nurses, digital nomads)\n\n**********************************************Why target this market? (i.e. the problem)**********************************************\n\nSo why international student housing? It’s a mouthful and, I’ll be the first to admit, “student housing” isn’t the sexiest market out there. And for that very reason, this niche housing market has flown under the radar of VCs, angel groups and other startups.\n\nImagine arriving in a new city for work or study; you need a move-in ready stay, yet you can’t afford a hotel and aren’t sure what the best (or even safe) neighborhoods are.\n\n- The traditional rental long-term rental market can’t serve you; you’re only here for 3 or 4 months, and don’t have time to pick out furniture\n    - Plus, you may not even have the credit score or guarantor needed to sign a lease\n- Hotels &amp; vacation rentals are way out of your price range\n- Traditional student housing, if there is any, has already been snapped up by full-time students\n\nAs a result, you’re left between a sketchy Craigslist sublet halfway across town or crashing at a youth hostel until you can figure something better out (as founder Perry did while studying abroad in Barcelona).\n\n************************************************So what’s the solution?************************************************\n\nThis market needs affordable, flexible, (trusted?) move-in ready housing near their place of work or study, often in the world’s toughest real estate markets.\n\n********************************Cortado’s Model********************************\n\nCortado’s model meets and exceeds these criteria, while generating outsized returns.\n\n1. Partner with local homeowners to quickly source new inventory\n2. Furnish and photograph the home in under 48 hours\n3. Market the home by-the-room with tiered “smart pricing” to provide an affordable, community-centered living experience to our guests (and peace of mind to their parents and universities), while maintaining a target revenue occupancy of 90-95%\n\n********************************************************************************How profitable is this model? (traction)********************************************************************************\n\nTo date, Cortado has generate over $350,000 in gross revenue, and returns of XX% across 9 rental properties in Washington, DC.\n\n- Our new housing now comes almost exclusively from homeowner referrals, showing supply-side traction for our master lease model\n- Demand, we were able to book all rooms for spring 2023 with $0 ad spend\n- Summer 2022 we booked out within 10 days\n- Programs such as Stanford, Atlantis, &amp;c &amp;c reach out to us on a regular basis (not enough rooms)\n\nWe project with just XX% of global market share, we could achieve an exit valuation of $XB\n\n**************************************How do we scale operations?**************************************\n\nThe key with any rental arbitrage business is margins; keep costs low and revenue high while scaling quickly &amp; sustainably. It’s a tricky balance to strike, and plenty of companies have burned to the ground trying to make it work.\n\n******************************Increasing Margins****************************** - After base rent and furniture, our biggest expense moving forward will be people, marketing &amp; software, costs that can be greatly reduced by leveraging and customizing AI tools just now hitting the market:\n\n- \n\n**How do we create value?**\n\n**********Brand**********\n\n- Cortado has already achieved a first-mover effect in Washington, DC, one of the country’s most-competitive real estate markets\n    - We can quickly replicate this in other domestic and especially foreign markets through B2B relationships and low-cost marketing outreach\n    - Although the barrier to entry to this market is low, brand recognition is incredibly important with slow-moving academic institutions like Stanford or Brown\n\n************Real Estate************\n\n- Blended model coupling master lease / management with ownership of the best-performing underlying assets\n- Alternative asset investing would allow Cortado to source new, unique inventory without the financial risk of traditional real estate acquisitions.\n    - Maintaining partial ownership drives higher exit valuation\n    - Returns of X% over typical rental\n\n********************Technology********************\n\n- Whether we sell the tech ourselves, or factor its worth into an eventual acquisition, Cortado’s proprietary AI PMS pushes an exit valuation from 2-3X towards the 10X+ range\n\n****************Use of Funds****************\n\n- Notes\n\n**************The Ask**************\n\n- Post-money SAFE with…\n    - Discount of X%\n    - Valuation Cap of $XX\n- Goal of raising $XX in pre-seed funds"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a perfect headline title about these articles  OpenAI launches ChatGPT API for businesses at competitive price OpenAI has made its API for ChatGPT generally available, based on a cheaper model that allows developers to easily call on the powerful generative AI for in-app usage.\n\nChatGPT API accesses a model known as ‘GPT-3.5 turbo’, the same used for the ChatGPT web product. Developers can easily interact with it via a simple endpoint and use it for any of the tasks that ChatGPT is capable of undertaking, from within their website or application.\n\nLeaning on its agreement with Microsoft, the model runs on Azure compute infrastructure which connects to user endpoints. This allows it to run independently of server load on the ChatGPT website, offering businesses a dedicated lane for AI processing.\n\nThe API will cost firms $0.002 (£0.0017) per 1,000 tokens, a value worth around 750 words, a sum 10 times smaller than other GPT-3.5 models.\n\nOpenAI stated that this was made possible by a 90% cost reduction in ChatGPT since December, without going into details on how this was achieved. \nEnterprise customers seeking reliable access to the model can also purchase dedicated instances, in an agreement in which OpenAI will allocate Azure compute infrastructure solely for the customers’ use.\n\nOpenAI has stated that this arrangement may be the most economical for developers expecting requests in excess of 450 million tokens per day, and can be agreed via direct contact with the company.\nOpenAI admitted that it has not met its own targets for delivering a stable service since December, but that it is committed to achieving this over time.\n“For the past two months our uptime has not met our own expectations nor that of our users,” read the blog post.\n\n“Our engineering team’s top priority is now stability of production use cases - we know that ensuring AI benefits all of humanity requires being a reliable service provider. Please hold us accountable for improved uptime over the upcoming months!”\n\nData processed through the API is not used for model training or other improvements to its service unless the organisation chooses to opt-in, and OpenAI has shelved its ‘pre-launch review’ policy which had required developers to flag what they used the model for before it could be integrated within their app.\n\n“Data submitted to the OpenAI API is not used for training, and we have a new 30-day retention policy and are open to less on a case-by-case basis,” tweeted Sam Altman, CEO at OpenAI.\n“For the past two months our uptime has not met our own expectations nor that of our users,” read the blog post.\n\n“Our engineering team’s top priority is now stability of production use cases - we know that ensuring AI benefits all of humanity requires being a reliable service provider. Please hold us accountable for improved uptime over the upcoming months!”\n\nData processed through the API is not used for model training or other improvements to its service unless the organisation chooses to opt-in, and OpenAI has shelved its ‘pre-launch review’ policy which had required developers to flag what they used the model for before it could be integrated within their app.\n\n“Data submitted to the OpenAI API is not used for training, and we have a new 30-day retention policy and are open to less on a case-by-case basis,” tweeted Sam Altman, CEO at OpenAI.\nWe've also removed our pre-launch review and made our terms of service and usage policies more developer-friendly.”\n\nThe latest model, gpt-3.5-turbo-0301, will be supported until June and a new stable release of the gpt-3.5-turbo is expected in April.\n\nDevelopers will be given the choice to adopt stable models or specific models according to their needs.\n\nPopular apps that have already made use of the ChatGPT API include Shop, the commerce app by Shopify, which has implemented ChatGPT API to provide more accurate in-app searches and personalised product suggestions for users.\nWhisper, OpenAI’s speech recognition system launched in September 2022, was also made available via API at $0.006 (£0.005) per minute of transcribed audio. The open-source model is capable of both transcribing audio and translating speech into English, and can process a number of common audio and video file types.\n\nThrough the API, developers can leverage the new ‘large-v2’ model for Whisper which brings speed and quality improvements to its output.\n\nThe API offering represents another step towards the full monetisation of ChatGPT, a vital task in the wake of reports that OpenAI’s models are too expensive to run without sizeable income. Altman himself described the firm’s costs as “eye-watering” in December 2022.\n\nMuch of this funding may have now been secured through Microsoft’s $10 billion investment in OpenAI, which cemented the dominance of both firms within the AI market. ChatGPT has an ever-expanding presence on Azure and the Redmond giant’s decision to integrate GPT-3.5 into Bing and Edge puts it on competitive footing against Google.\n\nSeparate from its influential investors, February saw OpenAI launch its paid tier ChatGPT Plus in the US, offering subscribers faster response times, stable access, and priority updates for $20 (£16) per month.\n\nSome have questioned the cost of ChatGPT Plus in the wake of the API announcement, particularly given that the API allows access to the GPT-3.5 large language model (LLM) at a fraction of that price.\n\n“I hope this pricing impacts ChatGPT+,” wrote a user on the Y Combinator forums.\n\n“$20 is equivalent to what, 10,000,000 tokens? At ~750 words/1k tokens, that’s 7.5 million words per month, or roughly 250,000 words per day, 10,416 words per hour, 173 words per minute, every minute, 24/7. I do not have that big of a utilisation need. It’s kind of weird to vastly overpay.”\n\nTo call ChatGPT, the free text-generating AI developed by San Francisco-based startup OpenAI, a hit is a massive understatement.\n\nAs of December, ChatGPT had an estimated more than 100 million monthly active users. It’s attracted major media attention and spawned countless memes on social media. It’s been used to write hundreds of e-books in Amazon’s Kindle store. And it’s credited with co-authoring at least one scientific paper.\n\nBut OpenAI, being a business — albeit a capped-profit one — had to monetize ChatGPT somehow, lest investors get antsy. It took a step toward this with the launch of a premium service, ChatGPT Plus, in February. And it made a bigger move today, introducing an API that’ll allow any business to build ChatGPT tech into their apps, websites, products and services.\n\n\nAn API was always the plan. That’s according to Greg Brockman, the president and chairman of OpenAI (and also one of the co-founders). He spoke with me yesterday afternoon via a video call ahead of the launch of the ChatGPT API.\n\n“It takes us a while to get these APIs to a certain quality level,” Brockman said. “I think it’s kind of this, like, just being able to meet the demand and the scale.”\n\nBrockman says the ChatGPT API is powered by the same AI model behind OpenAI’s wildly popular ChatGPT, dubbed “gpt-3.5-turbo.” GPT-3.5 is the most powerful text-generating model OpenAI offers today through its API suite; the “turbo” moniker refers to an optimized, more responsive version of GPT-3.5 that OpenAI’s been quietly testing for ChatGPT.\n\nPriced at $0.002 per 1,000 tokens, or about 750 words, Brockman claims that the API can drive a range of experiences, including “non-chat” applications. Snap, Quizlet, Instacart and Shopify are among the early adopters.\n\nThe initial motivation behind developing gpt-3.5-turbo might’ve been to cut down on ChatGPT’s gargantuan compute costs. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman once called ChatGPT’s expenses “eye-watering,” estimating them at a few cents per chat in compute costs. (With over a million users, that presumably adds up quickly.)\n\n\nBut Brockman says that gpt-3.5-turbo is improved in other ways.\n\n“If you’re building an AI-powered tutor, you never want the tutor to just give an answer to the student. You want it to always explain it and help them learn — that’s an example of the kind of system you should be able to build [with the API],” Brockman said. “We think this is going to be something that will just, like, make the API much more usable and accessible.”\n\nThe ChatGPT API underpins My AI, Snap’s recently announced chatbot for Snapchat+ subscribers, and Quizlet’s new Q-Chat virtual tutor feature. Shopify used the ChatGPT API to build a personalized assistant for shopping recommendations, while Instacart leveraged it to create Ask Instacart, an upcoming toll that’ll allow Instacart customers to ask about food and get “shoppable” answers informed by product data from the company’s retail partners.\n\n“Grocery shopping can require a big mental load, with a lot of factors at play, like budget, health and nutrition, personal tastes, seasonality, culinary skills, prep time, and recipe inspiration,” Instacart chief architect JJ Zhuang told me via email. “What if AI could take on that mental load, and we could help the household leaders who are commonly responsible for grocery shopping, meal planning, and putting food on the table — and actually make grocery shopping truly fun? Instacart’s AI system, when integrated with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, will enable us to do exactly that, and we’re thrilled to start experimenting with what’s possible in the Instacart app.”\n\nThose who’ve been closely following the ChatGPT saga, though, might be wondering if it’s ripe for release — and rightly so.\n\n\nEarly on, users were able to prompt ChatGPT to answer questions in racist and sexist ways, a reflection of the biased data on which ChatGPT was initially trained. (ChatGPT’s training data includes a broad swath of internet content, namely e-books, Reddit posts and Wikipedia articles.) ChatGPT also invents facts without disclosing that it’s doing so, a phenomenon in AI known as hallucination.\n\nChatGPT — and systems like it — are susceptible to prompt-based attacks as well, or malicious adversarial prompts that get them to perform tasks that weren’t a part of their original objectives. Entire communities on Reddit have formed around finding ways to “jailbreak” ChatGPT and bypass any safeguards that OpenAI put in place. In one of the less offensive examples, a staffer at startup Scale AI was able to get ChatGPT to divulge information about its inner technical workings.\n\nBrands, no doubt, wouldn’t want to be caught in the crosshairs. Brockman is adamant they won’t be. Why so? One reason, he says, is continued improvements on the back end — in some cases at the expense of Kenyan contract workers. But Brockman emphasized a new (and decidedly less controversial) approach that OpenAI calls Chat Markup Language, or ChatML. ChatML feeds text to the ChatGPT API as a sequence of messages together with metadata. That’s as opposed to the standard ChatGPT, which consumes raw text represented as a series of tokens. (The word “fantastic” would be split into the tokens “fan,” “tas” and “tic,” for example.)\n\nFor example, given the prompt “What are some interesting party ideas for my 30th birthday?” a developer can choose to append that prompt with an additional prompt like “You are a fun conversational chatbot designed to help users with the questions they ask. You should answer truthfully and in a fun way!” or “You are a bot” before having the ChatGPT API process it. These instructions help to better tailor — and filter — the ChatGPT model’s responses, according to Brockman.\n\n\n“We’re moving to a higher-level API. If you have a more structured way of representing input to the system, where you say, ‘this is from the developer’ or ‘this is from the user’ … I should expect that, as a developer, you actually can be more robust [using ChatML] against these kinds of prompt attacks,” Brockman said.\n\nAnother change that’ll (hopefully) prevent unintended ChatGPT behavior is more frequent model updates. With the release of gpt-3.5-turbo, developers will by default be automatically upgraded to OpenAI’s latest stable model, Brockman says, starting with gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 (released today). Developers will have the option to remain with an older model if they so choose, though, which might somewhat negate the benefit.\n\nWhether they opt to update to the newest model or not, Brockman notes that some customers — mainly large enterprises with correspondingly large budgets — will have deeper control over system performance with the introduction of dedicated capacity plans. First detailed in documentation leaked earlier this month, OpenAI’s dedicated capacity plans, launched today, let customers pay for an allocation of compute infrastructure to run an OpenAI model — for example, gpt-3.5-turbo. (It’s Azure on the back end, by the way.)\n\nIn addition to “full control” over the instance’s load — normally, calls to the OpenAI API happen on shared compute resources — dedicated capacity gives customers the ability to enable features such as longer context limits. Context limits refer to the text that the model considers before generating additional text; longer context limits allow the model to “remember” more text essentially. While higher context limits might not solve all the bias and toxicity issues, they could lead models like gpt-3.5-turbo to hallucinate less.\n\n\nBrockman says that dedicated capacity customers can expect gpt-3.5-turbo models with up to a 16k context window, meaning they can take in four times as many tokens as the standard ChatGPT model. That might let someone paste in pages and pages of tax code and get reasonable answers from the model, say — a feat that’s not possible today.\n\nBrockman alluded to a general release in the future, but not anytime soon.\n\n“The context windows are starting to creep up, and part of the reason that we’re dedicated-capacity-customers-only right now is because there’s a lot of performance tradeoffs on our side,” Brockman said. “We might eventually be able to offer an on-demand version of the same thing.”\n\nGiven OpenAI’s increasing pressure to turn a profit after a multibillion-dollar investment from Microsoft, that wouldn’t be terribly surprising."}]}

I WANT YOU TO LOKATE EXAMPLES OF LEGAL COMBINATIONS OF DAO AND SVT/SVT\n\nPros and Cons of Special Purpose Vehicles\nWhat It Means for Individual Investors\n\nA special purpose vehicle (SPV) is a legal entity created by the parent company but managed as a separate organization.\n\nKey Takeaways\nA special purpose vehicle (SPV) is a subsidiary legal entity created by a parent company to isolate the financial risk of certain assets, projects, or ventures.\n\nSPVs have their own assets, liabilities, and financial statements. The assets held within an SPV do not appear on the balance sheet of the parent company.\n\nSPVs are also special purpose entities (SPEs) and are considered off balance sheet vehicles (OBSVs).\nSPVs have unique tax benefits, are easy to set up, help manage risk, and have very few regulation requirements.\nThey can also be risky investments and hurt the parent company’s reputation should the assets perform poorly.\nDefinition and Examples of Special Purpose Vehicles\nA special purpose vehicle (SPV), also referred to as a special purpose entity (SPE), is a separate entity created by a parent organization to isolate certain financial risks.1 An SPV is a subsidiary legal structure that has its own assets and liabilities. It is an asset that is not shown on the balance sheet of the parent company.\n\nAlternate names: off-balance sheet vehicle (OBSV), special purpose entity\nSPVs can be created using different legal structures, such as a limited liability company (LLC), a trust, a limited partnership, or a corporation.\n\nThe sole purpose of an SPV is to separate the risk of the ventures in the SPV from the parent company’s operations. The parent company makes the business decisions, not the SPV, which is governed by rules clearly defined upon the entity’s creation.\n\nA company might create an SPV to separate the financial risks associated with a product or department so that the parent company isn’t damaged financially.\n\nFor example, banks often convert pools of mortgages into SPVs and sell them to investors to separate the investment risk and spread it among many investors. Another example of why a company might create an SPV is to create a lease that can be expensed on its income statement rather than being a liability on its balance sheet.\n\nHow Special Purpose Vehicles Work\nA parent company may have projects or assets it would like to keep off its balance sheets to avoid the financial risks these assets may impose on the parent company. To do so, it can create an SPV to isolate the assets and securitize them by selling shares to investors.\n\nNote\nThe parent company will create an SPV so it can sell assets on its balance sheet to the SPV and obtain financing for the subsidiary projects.\n\nDepending on the subsidiary project, the parent company may choose to create an SPV with one of the following legal entity structures:\n\nLimited Partnership (LP)\nLimited Liability Company (LLC)\nTrust\nCorporation\nOnce the SPV has been created, it obtains funds to purchase the assets from the parent company via debt financing and seeking investments from individual equity investors. Since the SPV now owns the assets, those assets become the collateral for the securities issued.\n\nAs a result, investors and lenders can evaluate the company by the quality of the collateral rather than the creditworthiness of the parent company, allowing for the potential for lower financing costs.\n\nSome of the most common reasons behind why a company may create an SPV include:\n\nSecuritization: SPVs are often used to securitize loans and receivables.\nAsset transfer: Some assets are difficult or impossible to transfer. Companies create SPVs to own a single asset or multiple assets by selling the asset to the SPV.\nFinancing: SPVs are a popular way to secure funding for a new venture without directly affecting the parent company’s financials.\nRaising capital: SPVs may be able to raise capital at more favorable rates as opposed to the parent company raising money.\nSPVs do not have independent management or employees and are instead administered by a trustee that follows defined rules to manage the assets. Furthermore, they are structured in such a way that they cannot go bankrupt in practice.\n\nPros and Cons of Special Purpose Vehicles\nPros\nSpecial tax benefits\n\nSpread the risk among many investors\n\nEasy to set up\n\nCorporations can isolate risks from the parent company\n\nCons\nLack of transparency\n\nLack of regulation\n\nReputational risk to the parent company\n\nLiquidity risks\n\nPros Explained\nSpecial tax benefits: Some assets of SPVs are exempt from direct taxes if they are established in specific geographical locations, such as the Cayman Islands.1\nSpread the risk among many investors: Assets held in an SPV are funded by debt and equity investments, spreading the risk of the assets among many investors and limiting the risk to each investor.\nEasy to set up: Depending on where you set up the SPV, it often requires very little cost and can be done in as little as 24 hours in some cases. Furthermore, there is little to no governmental authorization needed to establish the entity.\nCorporations can isolate risks from the parent company: Corporations benefit from isolating certain risks from the parent company. For example, should the assets experience a substantial loss in value, it wouldn't directly affect the parent company.\nCons Explained\nLack of transparency: Some SPVs can be very complex, with many layers of securitized assets. This complexity can make it very difficult to track the level of risk involved.\nLack of regulation: The regulatory standards that apply to the parent company do not necessarily apply to the assets held in the SPV, posing an indirect risk to the firm and investors.\nReputational risk to the parent company: If the performance of the assets within the SPV is worse than expected, it could still hurt the reputation of the parent company.\nLiquidity risks: If the assets in the SPV do not perform well, it will be difficult for investors and the parent company to sell the assets back on the open market, creating a risk to the liquidity of the assets.\nWhat It Means for Individual Investors\nIndividual investors should take note of companies that create SPVs as it may affect the investor’s decision to purchase shares of that company. Investors participating in the funding of an SPV should be clear about the purpose for the SPV, the financials, and the expected performance of its assets. \n\nNote\nInvesting directly in an SPV poses a higher risk than investing in other companies due to the lack of established reputation and historical performance. Investors may lack overall knowledge\n      \n      \n        \n            \n            \n          \n            \n            \n          \n      \n    \n  \n"}]}

The chapter mentioned three ways that IT can deliver value to the organization, through:\na. Implementing successful projects and keeping operations running\nb. Automating business processes\nc. Being available for the organization as needed\nExplain in your own words how these three actually provide value to organizations.\nProvide examples supporting each.\n7. What is a strategy? What is an IT strategic plan and why is it significant in aligning business objectives with IT?\n8. What is an IT Steering Committee? Summarize the various activities included as part of its\nscope.\n9. Operationalization translates the understanding of both, organization and IT objectives, into operating plans. Operating plans identify and schedule the IT projects that will be initiated and the IT service levels that will be expected. Delivery of these operating plans should be controlled by a series of governance processes. List and describe these processes.\n10. What is a Technical Steering Committee and what does it assess related to a technology solution?COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and related Technology) is a framework used to define governance and management of enterprise information and technology. According to COBIT, governance refers to the processes and policies that are put in place to ensure that an organization's information and technology resources are used effectively and efficiently to achieve the organization's goals and objectives.It is important for the business and its IT department to join efforts in delivering IT value because IT plays a critical role in supporting the business's operations and helping the business achieve its goals. By aligning the efforts of the business and IT, the organization can ensure that IT investments are aligned with the business's needs and objectives, and that IT is being used to support the business in the most effective way possible.The three widely recognized best practice IT-related frameworks are ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), COBIT, and ISO/IEC 27002. ITIL is a framework that provides best practices for managing and delivering IT services. It is typically used in IT service management. COBIT is a framework that provides a set of best practices for governing and managing enterprise information and technology. It is typically used in IT governance. ISO/IEC 27002 is a standard that provides guidelines for information security management systems. It is typically used in information security management.Organizations may consider implementing a joint framework between ITIL, COBIT, and ISO/IEC 27002 because each of these frameworks addresses different aspects of IT management and governance. By combining these frameworks, organizations can create a comprehensive approach to managing and governing their IT resources that takes into account all of the different factors that impact IT effectiveness and efficiency.An IT balanced scorecard is a tool that is used to measure the performance of an organization's IT department. It typically includes metrics that reflect the value that IT is delivering to the business, such as cost savings, increased productivity, and improved customer satisfaction. The IT balanced scorecard is used to help align the goals of the IT department with the overall goals of the organization, and to ensure that the IT department is contributing to the overall success of the business.The three ways that IT can deliver value to an organization are:\na. Implementing successful projectsand keeping operations running: By successfully delivering IT projects, an organization can improve its operations and processes, leading to increased efficiency and effectiveness. For example, implementing a new customer relationship management system can help an organization better track and manage customer interactions, leading to improved customer satisfaction.\nb. Automating business processes: By automating business processes, an organization can streamline its operations and reduce the need for manual labor. For example, automating the invoicing process can reduce the time and resources required to generate and send invoices, freeing up employees to focus on more value-added tasks.\nc. Being available for the organization as needed: By providing reliable IT services, an organization can ensure that its employees have the tools and resources they need to do their jobs effectively. For example, if an organization has an IT support team that is available to troubleshoot problems and resolve issues quickly, employees will be able to work more efficiently and effectively, leading to increased productivity.A strategy is a plan or course of action designed to achieve a particular goal. An IT strategic plan is a document that outlines the long-term goals and objectives of an organization's IT department, and the actions that will be taken to achieve those goals. It is significant in aligning business objectives with IT because it helps ensure that the IT department is working towards goals that are aligned with the overall goals of the organization, and that IT investments are being made in a way that supports the business's overall strategy.An IT Steering Committee is a group of individuals responsible for overseeing the management and use of an organization's IT resources. The scope of an IT Steering Committee may include activities such as reviewing and approving IT projects, setting IT policies and standards, and monitoring the performance of the IT department.The governance processes that are used to control the delivery of operating plans may include activities such as:Planning: Developing a plan for how IT projects and services will be deliveredMonitoring and controlling: Tracking the progress of IT projects and services and taking corrective action as neededReviewing and evaluating: Periodically reviewing the performance of IT projects and services to ensure that they are meeting the organization's objectivesCommunicating: Ensuring that all stakeholders are kept informed about the status of IT projects and servicesA Technical Steering Committee is a group of individuals responsible for assessing the technical aspects of a technology solution. The committee may assess factors such as the technical feasibility of the solution, the compatibility of the solution with the organization's existing IT infrastructure, and the potential risks and benefits of the solution.Explain the governance process from demand management,project intiation,technical review,Procurement and Vendor Management,Financial Management!network error"}]}

The increasing number of working professionals and the fast-paced corporate culture laid down the need for an app like Helpmates.

Provide a summary below.\n\nThe form \"Market Research Questionnaire For New Clients\" has been submitted with the following information:\n\nYour Company Name: Amanda Scarborough - Pitching Angel\n\nTo date, what has been the primary offer you've made to your audience?: Geared toward pitcher's themselves: Foundation Maximizer Program* Accuracy Maximizer Program Velocity Maximizer Program = Pitcher's Trifecta Bundle * can be purchased by itself, 5% of purchasers during March 2023 enrollment got Foundation ONLY, 95% of sales were some Trifecta &gt;&gt; https://www.pitching-angel.com/foundation Coach Maximizer Series - pitching training for coaches. pitcher's parents are encouraged to buy as well &gt;&gt;&gt; https://www.pitching-angel.com/coach These are the primary offers. There are other add-ons/upsells I have: a. Intro to Movement - mini course on movement pitches (for pitchers AND parents) b. Inner Circle- additional drills and workouts, only available for people who purchase trifecta (for pitchers) c. Coaching Up Confident Pitchers - for coaches and parents of pitchers about communicating with their pitcher The Pitching Angel Experience - 3 day, in person pitching event. the first one was Dec 2022\n\nDoes this offer have buyers yet?: 3200+ for Foundation....850 for Coach Maximizer Series.....1250 for Intro to Movement\n\nWho are the main buyers?: Trifecta: Parents of pitchers buying for their daughters. Biggest % of pitchers fall between ages 9-12. There are older pitchers 13+ included in there, as well as some college aged and beyond who work through the course. USUALLY this pitcher is more in her beginner to intermediate stages. Coach Course: Pitching coaches who coach pitchers in high school or travel ball or college, pitching coaches who give private lessons, an old baseball player who now is having to learn softball pitching, parents of pitchers who don't have my trifecta, parents of pitchers who DO have my trifecta, parents who are supportive and instrumental and involved in their pitcher's pitching journey. Recently made a post on my Facebook page asking people this same question, \"who are you\"? https://www.facebook.com/amanda9scarborough/posts/pfbid022Nd1zGgrfz6GjfNzxacoSm5m3VqtP859KQEWf1G56GVJeEKx7K8kPtRPddj8X3aXl?__cft__[0]=AZXO4iXV8DRIK0Eiv_ujYxaYJkp0mlCl0X7MqFIm_oV8D9JV4BJHiZlf3f7xB7Up9BwuqJSWXcgV_NHNS53FoOnDPLre0CfSj0IDiuzl9vdjivUZdQ-HNyHQ2qsXaElXal4&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R\n\nWhat do they want/desire more than anything else?: Trifecta: CONFIDENCE &amp; self-belief for their child. Parents want their pitcher to reignite their love/passion for pitching. They want their pitcher to have fun and put in the work. They want to know she is learning the right things mechanically when it comes to pitching. They want her to stay healthy mentally and physically while playing/learning a position she's interested in. They want \"her light to shine\". Ultimately, they want their daughter to have more pitching time, but it's based on everything listed before this. As a side note: an indirect benefit that I did not expect, but one that so many all say, is how through the course they create a \"common language\" with their pitcher and they're able to communicate and work with their pitcher in a way that makes everything seem easier and get on the same page together. Coach: If it's a parent buying, they want a way to learn how to help their pitcher when she's practicing at home outside of lessons. The parent wants to make sure he/she is not \"messing her up\" and telling her the wrong thing. If it's a team coach buying, they want a way to communicate with pitchers who all work with different private coaches. If it's a coach who gives lessons buying, they want new drills, new communication and to get insight as to how/what I teach to be able to bring it to their lessons. The REAL desire of a coach for this coach course could definitely use some more insight and understanding. It has always come second fiddle to my training for pitchers, but has just as much potential as the pitching training itself.\n\nWhat's the main reason they buy?: Trifecta: They don't have a pitching coach near them. OR They have a pitching coach, but they want focused work to put in in between lessons. OR The pitcher has plateau'd in speed and results. OR They simply want new drills &amp; workouts. OR They want to make sure they're learning the \"right\" thing. Coach: As a parent buying, they want information to better support their pitcher. As a coach buying, they want a fresh approach, new drills and workouts to implement with their pitcher.\n\nWhat is the biggest problem or challenge they are facing right now?: Trifecta: Lack of confidence, lack of work ethic, lack of pitching speed, a mechanical habit they cannot fix, a plateau in speed, inconsistency from the pitcher they see at practice to the pitcher they see during a game, inconsistency with accuracy, getting \"stuck\". Coach: same as above. Overwhelmed with the amount of information that's out there on pitching.\n\nWhat frustrates them?: Trifecta: How hard pitching is. The unknown about pitching. Not knowing if what they're learning is the right thing. Having to google a ton of drills and find them on their own somewhere on the internet. A pitching coach who is teaching them the wrong thing. No direction in terms of what should be learned first and any type of progression. Also....wasting time either learning the wrong things or wasting time pitching, only to see their daughter quit pitching. Coach: Really, the same answer as above.\n\nWhat causes them pain?: Trifecta: seeing their daughter struggle. seeing their daughter not pitch to her potential. Coach: as a parent who buys, seeing their daughter struggle and want to quit. as a coach who buys, losing games, their pitcher not being able to get out of an inning, not being able to communicate with a pitcher\n\nWhat are their insecurities?: Trifecta: that their pitcher will never figure it out, money &amp; time being wasted, that their pitcher isn't \"tall enough\" or \"good enough\" to do it, that their pitcher isn't pitching a certain speed by a certain age, that their pitcher isn't up to the level as other pitchers on her team. Coach: For parents: that they they're going to \"mess their daughter up\" and tell her the wrong things. For coaches: that the pitcher isn't listening to what they're telling her because the pitcher doesn't believe in WHAT he/she is telling her.\n\nWhat are they angry about?: Trifecta: This is a good question, not sure if I have the answer to this one right now! Maybe they're pitcher making the same mechanical mistake over and over again and not being able to adjust? A pitcher having untapped potential and not putting in the work to see what she's capable of. Coach: That they've been taught outdated mechanics and have to learn something new/change their old way of thinking. For both pitching courses and coach course, definitely need to explore more about what they're \"angry\" about.\n\nWho are they angry at and who do they blame for their problems?: The parent blames themselves or their coach. Rarely are they angry at their child. :)\n\nWhat is the age, gender, education level, and/or location of your ideal buyer?: For pitching courses: Pitcher age: 9-12 Pitcher's parent age: 35-45 Location: Texas, California, Florida, Ohio, Illinois. Honestly they're all over the country and world. It would be great to see exact %s. Education level: Not sure\n\nWho do they follow online?: Toni Paisley Fastpitch Power Foster Fastpitch DR3 Fastpitch Rugged Softball Paulygirl Fastpitch - Rick Pauly Most of their pages are tagged in the comments on this post: https://www.facebook.com/amanda9scarborough/posts/pfbid02XeWcT9Yz31kaaBYdsekKkCdqvNiu4cWz4rFg76eG1PGMHrEnVgT7dh1LvfATp5CQl?__cft__[0]=AZWQiizvTul046pDBhKEYpja-PZpbXGZAaP7BH_fWC1icufDdjSkaaUI2NYHo4NsC9b_sG1VRbLSlZ6EmJO6JHN-srOCQkCNSx8ktDLj9jWDtUbUZe_OG5PwfNj5rTsF0I5UTtYDY6Aauvd-S87UaewI&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R\n\nDo they hang out in any specific groups or forums?: The Fastpitch Zone - FB group Fastpitch Talk - FB group Softball Pitching Advice &amp; Analysis - FB group discussfastpitch.com heybucket.com thesoftballzone.com .....and I bet so many places I don't know about!...yet\n\nCompetition:\n\nCompetition\n\nTake a look at the market for your product/service and evaluate which other companies are selling a product that would compete with yours...\n\nInformation on Your Primary Customers:\n\nInformation on Your Primary Customers\nThis will help us get to know more about your ideal avatar and ensure we are speaking directly to them...\n\nWhat other products/services like this one are your customers buying, if any?: Paisley's Pitching - https://www.paisleyspitching.com Coachataclick - https://www.coachataclick.com/?r_done=1 Paulgirl Fastpitch - https://www.paulygirlfastpitch.com Fastpitch Online Academy - https://www.fastpitchonlineacademy.com I believe they all have online presence. Some offer online lessons, which I do not. And/or video breakdown, which usually I do not.\n\nWhat separates your products/services from the competition?: Keeping it simple and teaching in a way that's clear and concise. Ability to have lifetime access and go at your own speed through the information. Easy to follow progressions. Will answer emails/messages from people inside as they come in if they need help. Breaking down pitching in a way that seems doable and easy for pitchers, no matter where they live. The trust they have in me from my credibility in what I achieved as a player, to how long I've had an online presence for 15 years now, to being on ESPN calling the WCWS. Being relatable...the fact I was a shorter pitcher who could throw hard AND the fact that I wasn't always the best when I was growing up. Ability to break down the mental game, talk about it, write about it, coach about it and get people to relate to it. - honestly this is probably one of the biggest things.\n\nCreator:\n\nCreator\nLet's get to know more about you and the desired outcome of your offers...\n\nWhat is important to know about you?: May of 2020 was the first time I came out with anything online with training like this. I think there's so much potential to reach TONS of people who have no idea who I am. My Amanda-scarborough.com website gets traffic from the content on it but has not been redone or integrated with anything pitching angel related and I feel like it could connect and multiple everything that's already been done. I'm ready to not only reach more people but speak to them more directly so they realize the impact my courses can have on their pitching families journey to help keep their pitcher happy, confident and pitching for a longer period of time.\n\nWhy did you create this particular offer (course/program/product/service)?: It started first and foremost with my Foundation Maximizer. Everything revolves around teaching pitchers &amp; their parents the keys to a solid pitching foundation, because if you don't have a solid foundation, more frustration will come along the way because results won't come as easily in the longterm. And seeing results is what keeps a pitcher confidence. A foundation is the key to confidence and I want pitchers to feel like they can not only learn about what a solid foundation. is, but execute it. And if they execute it, then they'll pitch longer because the chances of them being more confidence is higher. And then on top of that, if they pitch for a longer period of time, I know they'll become even stronger, successful WOMEN once they've stopped pitching. I truly believe pitching can change a girl's life like it did mine. Then as a side note to that: I wanted to create a framework, structure and progression for people to follow instead of just piecemealing YouTube videos of mine or someone else's together. Pitching families and pitchers have so much confusion about what's the \"right\" way to learn pitching mechanics and make sure their daughters are being taught the right thing.\n\nProof:\n\nProof\nPerhaps the strongest mental trigger of them all is showcasing the success your customers are already having... but don't worry if you're just getting started, we will help you build your library of proof (testimonials, endorsements, case studies, etc) along the way.\n\nPlease list any elements that showcase credibility in your field... (i.e. education, certifications, accomplishments, awards, customer testimonials, etc...): See links to sales pages above, there are lots on there and I have Google Drive folders of them. I want us to find a way to get even MORE of these along the way!"}]}

Be sure to identify the different types of mission statements, provide several examples of each, discuss the positives and negatives of each type as compared to one another and also include suggested processes for developing a mission statement.\nCorporate mission statements are often considered a vital part of any organization. They are used to define the purpose and goals of the organization, and they serve as a guide for decision-making and strategy development. A well-crafted mission statement can help an organization focus its efforts, communicate its values to stakeholders, and inspire its employees.There are several types of mission statements that organizations can choose from. These include:Market-oriented mission statements: These mission statements focus on the needs of the organization's customers and the value that the organization provides to them. They often include language about the organization's products or services, and how they meet the needs of its customers. Examples of market-oriented mission statements include:Amazon: \"Our vision is to be earth's most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything they might want to buy online.\"Coca-Cola: \"To refresh the world in mind, body, and spirit, to inspire moments of optimism and happiness through our brands and actions.\"Product-oriented mission statements: These mission statements focus on the organization's products or services, and the unique benefits they offer. They may include language about the organization's commitment to quality, innovation, or sustainability. Examples of product-oriented mission statements include:Tesla: \"To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.\"Nike: \"To bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.\"Public service mission statements: These mission statements focus on the impact that the organization has on society, and its commitment to making a positive difference. They may include language about the organization's values, and its responsibility to stakeholders. Examples of public service mission statements include:Patagonia: \"Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.\"UNICEF: \"To defend the rights of every child, everywhere, every day, and to help children survive and thrive, from early childhood through adolescence.\"Societal mission statements: These mission statements focus on the organization's commitment to making a positive impact on society, and aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They are relatively new types of mission statement that mainly used by companies that want to contribute to a more sustainable world. Examples of societal mission statements include:IKEA: \"To create a better everyday life for the many people.\"The Body Shop: \"To dedicate our business to the pursuit of social and environmental change.\"All of these types of mission statements have their own advantages and disadvantages. Market-oriented mission statements, for example, can help an organization stay competitive by focusing on customer needs. Product-oriented mission statements can help an organization differentiate itself from competitors by highlighting the unique benefits of its products or services. Public service mission statements can help an organization build trust with stakeholders by highlighting its commitment to making a positive impact on society. However, societal mission statements can help organizations align its activities with the global goals for sustainable development.On the other hand, market-oriented mission statements can also be seen as shallow or superficial, if they don't address the impact of their operations on society or the environment. Product-oriented mission statements can be criticized if they don't take into account the social and environmental impact of the production. Public service mission statements can be criticized if they don't address the organization's impact on society in a concrete way.Developing a mission statement can be a challenging process, but there are several steps that organizations can take to make it easier. These include:Defining the organization's values: Before developing a mission statement, it's important to define the organization's valuesGenerate a detailed outline for this artcle in sections and sub sectionsI.

Use active voice. Don't simply repeat the headers in the above contextWhen it comes to developing a mission statement, it's important to approach the process with a clear understanding of the organization's values, stakeholders, and goals. By taking the time to define these elements, organizations can create a mission statement that truly reflects the purpose and direction of the company.The first step in the process is to define the organization's values. These are the principles that guide the organization's decision-making and actions. They can include things like integrity, innovation, or social responsibility. By clearly defining these values, the organization can ensure that they are reflected in its mission statement.Once the values have been defined, the next step is to identify the organization's stakeholders. These are the people or groups that have a vested interest in the organization's success. They can include customers, employees, shareholders, and members of the community. By taking the time to understand the needs and concerns of these stakeholders, the organization can ensure that its mission statement addresses their interests and concerns.With a clear understanding of its values and stakeholders, the organization can then determine its purpose and goals. What is the company's ultimate objective? What does the company want to achieve in the short and long term? This step is crucial to make sure that the mission statement aligns with the overall direction and purpose of the organization.Once the organization has a clear understanding of its values, stakeholders, and goals, it can begin to draft different versions of the mission statement. It's important to keep in mind that a mission statement should be clear, concise, and memorable. It should be easy to understand and communicate to all stakeholders. It's also important to test these different versions with different groups of people to see how they resonate with them.After testing the different versions, it's time to finalize the mission statement. This is the statement that will guide the organization's decisions and actions. Once the final version is chosen, it's important to communicate it to all stakeholders. This could be through internal communications, on the company's website, or even through advertising. It's essential that everyone within the organization understands the mission statement and is aligned with the purpose and direction of the company.In conclusion, developing a mission statement is an essential process for any organization. It helps define the purpose and direction of the company, and it serves as a guide for decision-making and strategy development. By taking the time to define the organization's values, identify its stakeholders, and determine its purpose and goals, organizations can create a mission statement that truly reflects its purpose and direction. Remember that a well-crafted mission statement can help an organization focus its efforts, communicate its values to stakeholders, and inspire its employees to work towards a common goal.write more about 2nd paragraphWhen defining the organization's values, it's important to remember that these values should be reflected in the company's mission statement. The values should be principles that guide the organization's decision-making and actions. They are often used to define the company's culture, and they help set the tone for how the company operates.Examples of values that organizations may choose to include in their mission statement include:Integrity: a commitment to honesty and ethical behavior in all aspects of the company's operations.Innovation: a commitment to creating new and better products or services, or finding new and more efficient ways of operating.Social responsibility: a commitment to making a positive impact on society and the environment.It's also essential to remember that values should be specific, measurable and achievable. They should align with the overall direction and purpose of the organization, and they should be relevant to its mission statement.By clearly defining these values, the organization can ensure that they are reflected in its mission statement. This helps in the decision making process and the overall direction of the company. It also helps to align the company culture and values towards a common goal. It serves as a guiding principle for the employees and it helps them to act accordingly."}]}

It teaches knowledge and skills in all aspects of restaurant business establishment and operation, and representative lectures include 'Strategy', 'Price', 'Content', and 'Advertisement'. Looking at the emergence of generative AI technologies such as chatGPT, we intend to actively utilize them in operating the academy. As the first action, we are planning to release a lecture called 'AI MBA (Marketing, Branding, Advertising)' this time. The main students are restaurant owners in their 30s and 50s, and their sales range from $50,000 to $1 million per month. And the main content of the lecture is to use generative AI such as chatGPT and DALL-E to help you do marketing, branding, and advertising yourself, and to teach you how to use AI to create content that can be used immediately. However, since the students lack understanding of AI and development, it is judged that they will prefer methods such as providing prompts that can be directly entered into chatGPT rather than teaching fundamental knowledge about AI. I want you to remember this situation and help me. First of all, what I want is to ask 'good questions' in order to figure out 'what questions can students ask to get good answers'."}]}

They would love to exchange multiple handles with people they meet, but it's impossible to do so without coming across as \"weird\". With only one platform exchanged, they know nothing about each other, which leads to boring conversations that die out quickly. You only have one chance to swap one piece of info with someone you just met.\nSoshi empowers you to capitalize on this chance. We are a mobile app that allows you to share all of your contact & social media info in one place, with one tap. Our mission is to help people keep the conversation going. \n \nAre you currently engaged in any other incubator or accelerator programs? If so, which ones:\nWe are not part of any other incubator or accelerator programs, but we are Founders in Startup Shell.\n \nDescribe how your team will benefit from having dedicated desk space in the hatchery.\nWe’re always working in different places. We need a set meeting place that we can depend on to have the atmosphere and resources we need to be productive. The Hatchery offers just this—with quality monitors, whiteboards, storage space, and other like minded individuals—and conveniently happens to be a midpoint between our team’s apartments.\n\n\nWhat is the ownership breakdown of the founders and/or investors?\nThe ownership of Soshi is split among our three founders and Sri Kanipakala (developer). Jason and UV each own 40%, Sri owns 15%, and Sid owns 5%. No investors or third parties have equity in the company as of now. \n\nWhere did you come up with the idea and why did you choose it?\njason\n(From the perspective of Sid Jagtap - Co-Founder)\nI was watching an episode of The Office one night. In the episode, Ryan starts a venture called WUPHF: a platform that would allow people to send a single message and have it delivered in multiple mediums to the recipient. Jim could send a simple “hey” to Dwight, and Dwight would get the message not just over text, but also over email, fax, phone; you name it.\nAlthough this idea was a joke, it created a spark in my head, leading me to the solution to a problem I encountered all the time. The problem would usually go like this: I would meet and add a girl usually over snapchat, and the conversation stays on the surface until one of us gets bored and stops replying. How am I supposed to keep the conversation going when I know nothing about them? \nJust like how WUPHF allowed people to access multiple platforms through one entry point, I thought about how this concept could change the game in my social life. What if when I meet someone new, I could share not just my number, but all of my social media info? Breaking the ice would be 10 times easier. Shortly after, I called Uv and Jason to tell them my idea and right there Soshi was born; with the mission of helping people like us turn first conversations into lasting connections.\n\n\n\nWhat is new about the idea? \nThe idea of compacting social media handles into one place exists, but only in the professional world. Soshi tailors this idea to a different market: the social scene. \nIn order to provide a fun, socially acceptable, and efficient way to swap info, we allow people to express themselves beyond just their social media accounts. \nWe have integrated “passions” to serve as icebreakers, and a casual & fun UI designed specifically for the social scene. Also, with our new “Soshi Groups” feature, users can create a group, joinable through a single “Soshi code” and every member is able to see and share their socials with others in the group. Greek life organizations, clubs, athletic teams, resident halls and other groups can create their own Soshi groups to quickly connect their members.\n\n\nWho are existing competitors in the market and how big are they? \nBlue Social: ~50k users\nLink.me: ~500K users\nDot: users undisclosed\n\nHow will the company make money?\nWe plan to monetize first by selling Soshi portals, which allow users to share their profile using NFC. Focusing on the college market (19.4 million students), of which ~55% identify as \"extroverts\" and use multiple social media accounts, making our target market ~10.67 million people.\nAt $9/unit (~$7 profit), we could generate up to $96.03 million in revenue (or $74.69 million in profit) within our target market alone.\nDue to the low LTV per customer with NFC products, we also plan to explore other ways to monetize at greater scale (premium features & partnerships with bars/venues).\n\n\nWhat do you uniquely know, understand, or have access to that puts you in a position to be successful with this idea?\nWe live the life of our target customer—as social college students, we know that people like us want to exchange all sorts of social media info when they first connect with someone. As our users have told us, having lots of surface level info on a person makes breaking the ice 10 times faster and easier. \nThere are “digital business cards'' out there, but here’s the thing: People are going to give you some weird looks if you’re passing around your “digital business card” at a bar. We know that people need a fun, casual, and socially acceptable way to swap multiple social media handles at once, and this does not exist in today’s market.\nEach of us having 3+ years in entrepreneurship and 3+ years in software development, we believe we are the right team to satisfy this need.\n\nIs there a social mission/social benefit that your company advances?\nWe encourage people to take the step outside and experience that in-person, face-to-face conversation. We’ve received lots of feedback from our users and thanking us for making connecting with someone so easy!\n\nOptional: You may submit a 1 minute video introducing the CEO & Founder describing your idea and why it is a good idea.\n\n\nIs there anything else we should know about your company and/or why you should be admitted to the Hatchery program? \nHaving been friends with Thai (Mindgrasp), Bryan (Quandary), and Zach (Shellter), members of last year’s batch, we have heard great things about the program. With our app just having reached 1k users through organic growth, we could greatly benefit from the resources and mentorship provided by the Hatchery to further scale, improve engagement, and take our startup to the next level.\nUnlike most companies, our work goes hand-in-hand with our social life. We are continuously working, going out and meeting new people, and using Soshi to turn those people into both connections and new users. \n\n\""}]}

The Dutch trade minister has confirmed talks are ongoing.\n\nWennink said it seemed contradictory that U.S. chip manufacturers are able to sell their most advanced chips to Chinese customers, while ASML is only able to sell older chipmaking equipment.\n\"American chip manufacturers have no problem with China as a customer,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, \"it is common knowledge that chip technology for purely military applications is usually 10, 15 years old. (Yet) the technology used to make such chips can still be sold to China,\" he added."}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "please identify the 10 main takeaways of the following article\n\n\"Zinssparen beim Broker\nTrade Republic zahlt ab sofort 2% Zinsen auf nicht investiertes Geld. Ein bislang unschlagbares Angebot – das nicht ohne Hintergedanken daherkommt.\nETFs, Einzelaktien, Sparpläne – eigentlich sieht so das Metier des Neobrokers Trade Republic aus. Und so mussten bislang auch nur andere Aktien-Broker das Berliner Fintech als Wettbewerber fürchten. Seit dem vierten Januar hat sich der Konkurrenzkreis von Trade Republic erheblich vergrößert: Denn das Start-up hat sich zu einer Art Tagesgeldkonto gewandelt und bietet plötzlich bessere Konditionen als deutsche Direktbanken. Allen Kunden will der Broker ab sofort 2% Zinsen auf das nicht investierte Geld auf dem Verrechnungskonto zahlen. Das Angebot gilt für Cash-Guthaben bis 50.000€ und ist zeitlich unbefristet. Direktbanken wie die ING oder die Consorsbank haben zwar inzwischen ähnlich hohe Zinssätze zu bieten, allerdings gelten die nur für wenige Monate – anschließend rutschen die Guthabenzinsen für Kunden wieder in den Null-Komma-Irgendwas-Bereich ab. Was verspricht sich der Broker davon? Wie sicher ist das Geld bei Trade Republic und wie kann es sich das Fintech überhaupt leisten, seinen Kunden so viel Geld zu schenken? Und werden die Direktbanken bald nachziehen?\n\nTrade Republic wirbt mit Zinseszinseffekt\n“Die Zinsen werden live berechnet und, anders als bei vielen anderen Anbietern, monatlich ausgezahlt, woraus sich ein attraktiver Zinseszinseffekt ergibt”, heißt es in der offiziellen Pressemitteilung von Anfang Januar. Ein Zinseszinseffekt stellt sich durch die monatliche Ausschüttung zwar schon ein – ob man ihn als außerordentlich attraktiv bezeichnen möchte, dürfte aber Ansichtssache sein. Mal angenommen, ein Kunde hat 40.000€ auf dem Verrechnungskonto bei Trade Republic liegen. Bei 2% Zinsen müsste der Broker ihm im Jahr 800€ auszahlen. Werden die 2% dagegen monatlich gutgeschrieben, also immer wieder auf neuer, stetig steigender Grundlage berechnet, beläuft sich der Zinsertrag nach einem Jahr auf 807,37€. Ein Plus von 7€, das ganz nett ist, aber den Braten nicht unbedingt fett macht.\n\nSeit wann zahlen Broker Zinsen?\nVielleicht muss man aber auch erst mal erklären, warum Trade Republic, das ja eigentlich als Broker gegründet wurde, überhaupt Guthaben-Zinsen zahlen darf. Der Grund ist, dass der Neobroker das Vermögen seiner Kunden nicht selbst verwaltet, sondern Geschäftsbanken dies für ihn übernehmen. Alles andere wäre auch illegal, denn als Broker besitzt Trade Republic keine Banklizenz. Eröffnen Kunden ein Depot, dann erhalten Sie automatisch ein Verrechnungskonto bei der Deutschen Bank oder bei der Citibank. Einige alte Trade Republic-Kunden lassen ihr Geld immer noch von der Solaris Bank verwahren, mit der das Start-up 2019 ursprünglich gestartet ist. Inzwischen stellt die Deutsche Bank den Großteil der Verrechnungskonten, auf die Kunden erst einmal Geld einzahlen müssen, um es anschließend an der Börse investieren zu können. Solche Partnerschaften sind ganz normal. Bei dem Konkurrenten Scalable Capital wird ein Konto bei der Baader Bank eröffnet, der Anbieter Smartbroker kooperiert mit der BNP PARIBAS. \n\nDas Geld ist sicher\nDie Geschäftsbanken, die für Trade Republic-Kunden das Geld verwahren, sind allesamt regulierte Geldhäuser und werden von der Bafin überwacht. Sie alle unterliegen der europäischen Einlagensicherung, somit ist das Geld der Depotkunden – genau wie auf dem Tagesgeld-, Festgeld- und Girokonto – im Falle einer Bankenpleite geschützt. Zumindest bis zu einer Höhe von 100.000€.\n\nWie kann sich Trade Republic das leisten?\nAus welchen Mitteln will Trade Republic nun jedem der schätzungsweise über 2 Mio. Kunden 2% Zinsen bezahlen? Auch dafür muss man etwas ausholen und in das Zinsgeschäft der Banken einsteigen.\n\nGeschäftsbanken haben die Möglichkeit, das Geld ihrer Kunden bei der EZB zu lagern, das Ganze nennt sich Einlagefazilität. Im Gegenzug erhalten sie dafür von der Zentralbank einen Zinssatz, den sogenannten Einlagesatz. In Zeiten einer strikten Nullzinspolitik lag der über Jahre im Minusbereich, die Banken mussten also ihrerseits der EZB Geld bezahlen, um ihr Geld dort parken zu dürfen – und haben die Mehrkosten an ihre Kunden weitergegeben. Anbieter von Girokonten, aber auch Broker, die mit betroffenen Geschäftsbanken kooperieren, haben also vielfach Negativzinsen erhoben. Jetzt, da der Einlagensatz als Reaktion auf die hohe Inflation bei 2% liegt und mutmaßlich noch weiter ansteigen wird, hat sich der Wind gedreht. Die Banken werden wieder belohnt für die Einlagen, die sie bei der EZB parken, und das verschafft auch den kooperierenden Brokern Mehreinnahmen. „Mit der Wiedereinführung der Zinsen durch die EZB reagieren wir zügig auf eine neue Marktsituation”, sagt Trade Republic-Chef Christian Hecker auf Anfrage. Man ermögliche den Kunden, ihr Geld auch dann für sich arbeiten zu lassen, wenn es noch nicht investiert ist. “Damit vereinen wir die wichtigsten Möglichkeiten, Geld anzulegen, in einer Anwendung. Einfach und demokratisch – wie es unserer Mission entspricht.”\n\nEntwicklung Zinssatz der EZB für die Einlagefazilität von 1999 bis 2022\nEntwicklung Zinssatz der EZB für die Einlagefazilität von 1999 bis 2022, Quelle: Statistisches Bundesamt\nEin Minusgeschäft?\nAuch wenn es klingt, als würde Trade Republic den Einlagezins einfach an die Kunden weiterreichen, kann man davon ausgehen, dass der Broker ein Minusgeschäft macht. Schließlich wird zum Beispiel auch die Deutsche Bank einen Teil des Einlagezinses abhaben wollen, sodass Trade Republic unterm Strich vielleicht nur 1,5% davon übrig bleiben. Vielleicht kann die Deutsche Bank auch noch höhere Erträge herausholen, indem sie beispielsweise einen Teil der Kundengelder in Form von Krediten ausgibt. Dann kommen bei Deutsche Bank und Trade Republic vielleicht zusammen 2,5% an und Trade Republic kann 1,7% oder 1,8%  für sich behalten. Wie die Aufteilung genau ist, wissen nur die Unternehmen selbst, denn das ist Geschäftsgeheimnis.\n\nWarum das Ganze?\nNun wird sich kein Unternehmen unüberlegt ins Minus stürzen, und auch Trade Republic dürfte sich sehr wohl etwas von der Zins-Offerte erhoffen. In der Pressemitteilung hat der Broker den Zweck des Ganzen nur oberflächlich angerissen: Man wolle die “Marktführerschaft als Europas größte Sparplattform ausbauen”, so die Begründung.\n\nWenn das Ziel gewesen sein sollte, einfach mal wieder die Werbetrommel zu rühren, dann ist das jedenfalls gelungen. In den Wirtschaftsmedien des Landes hatte Trade Republic schon kurz nach Ankündigung seinen Platz in den Schlagzeilen. Und allein das könnte dem Broker schon einen erheblichen Umsatz bescheren. Es wäre schließlich nicht überraschend, wenn Trade Republic mit dem neuen Angebot eine gewaltige Zahl an Neukunden gewinnen würde. Die Macher hinter dem Broker sind zumindest optimistisch: Bisher habe man sehr viel positives Feedback von Kunden zum Zinssparen bekommen, meint Mitgründer Christian Hecker. Man heiße jedenfalls jeden willkommen, der sein Geld für sich arbeiten lassen möchte.\n\nDoch die Stimmung an den Börsen ist durch den Ukraine-Krieg und die damit verbundene Energiekrise weiterhin betrübt, und das dürfte auch der Neobroker in den vergangenen Quartalen durch eine rückläufige Zahl an Transaktionen zu spüren bekommen haben. Vielleicht sollen die neuen Zinsen also auch wieder zum Investieren anspornen: Um sie zu kassieren, müssen Kunden schließlich ein Depot eröffnen und Geld aufs Verrechnungskonto überweisen. So liegt es schon mal bereit in der App und damit nur einen Finger-Swipe entfernt von einem Investment. Die Schwelle zum Investieren ist also deutlich niedriger, wenn schon mal Geld da ist. Wir erinnern uns: Trade Republic verdient sein Geld vornehmlich mit Provisionen, die der Broker von ETF-Anbietern und Handelsplattformen erhält.\n\nVielleicht wird Trade Republic auch erst in ein paar Monaten so richtig profitieren, wenn die EZB erneut den Leitzins anhebt – und damit die Einnahmen für den Broker und seine Partnerbanken nochmals steigen. Gibt Trade Republic dann weiterhin “nur” 2% Zinsen weiter, fällt die Marge höher aus.\n\nWo ist der Haken?\nBei scheinbar kostenlosen Zinsgeschenken ist Misstrauen nicht unangebracht. Aber tatsächlich hat die Zins-Offerte von Trade Republic keinen Haken. Es gibt weder versteckte Kosten noch andere Fallstricke. Einziges Manko, wenn man so will, ist eine fehlende Garantie. Auch der Broker möchte kein Langzeit-Versprechen abgeben und die Zinsen gelten “bis auf Weiteres”, das heißt: Sie können theoretisch auch jederzeit wieder sinken oder komplett abgeschafft werden. “Es gibt eine Reihe von makroökonomischen Faktoren, die zu einer Änderung des Zinssatzes führen können”, schreibt Trade Republic dazu im FAQ-Bereich. Dazu gehörten auch “Änderungen des Leitzinses im Rahmen der Finanzpolitik der EZB.” Man werde die Kunden aber über jede Änderung frühzeitig informieren, heißt es weiter. Wie lange sich das Angebot halten wird, bleibt also abzuwarten. Sollte es etwa im Frühjahr wieder gekippt werden, wäre allerdings klar, dass Trade Republic doch keine besseren Konditionen bietet als die gewöhnlichen Direktbanken. Apropos: Wie stehen die eigentlich zur neuen Konkurrenz am Sichteinlagen-Himmel?\n\n“Wir entscheiden in Ruhe”\nDie Panik scheint bei den großen Direktbanken des Landes jedenfalls noch nicht ausgebrochen zu sein. Man entscheide “in Ruhe”, ob nun Anpassungen nötig sein sollten, sagt etwa ein Sprecher der Consorsbank. Als Direktbank der Marke BNP Paribas verwaltet das Institut rund 60 Mrd. Euro an Kundeneinlagen – und zahlt für Geld auf dem Tagesgeldkonto pro Jahr sogar 2,1% Zinsen. Das ist mehr als Trade Republic und gilt außerdem für Beträge von bis zu 1 Mio. Euro. Dafür ist das Angebot auf sechs Monate begrenzt, wer noch Wertpapiere dazu kauft, kann auf maximal ein Jahr verlängern. Könnte Trade Republic den Direktbanken nun nicht die Kunden streitig machen? Man beobachte kontinuierlich den Markt und prüfe das eigene Angebot auf Wettbewerbsfähigkeit, um dann bei Bedarf eine “Anpassung vorzunehmen”, heißt es aus der Kommunikationsabteilung. Auszuschließen ist also nicht, dass die Consorsbank ihre Zinsen nochmals anpassen wird.\n\n2% Zinsen bietet die ING seinen Tagesgeld-Sparern. Vorausgesetzt, sie besaßen in den vergangenen sechs Monaten noch kein Tagesgeldkonto bei der ING. Das Angebot gilt ebenfalls nur befristet, schon nach vier Monaten müssen sich die Kunden wieder mit dem Basiszins von 0,3% pro Jahr begnügen. Anpassungen hält man auch hier (zumindest noch) nicht für notwendig: “Sollten es die weiteren Entwicklungen zulassen, werden wir auch beim Extra-Konto den Basiszins weiter erhöhen”, sagt ein Unternehmenssprecher und verweist darauf, dass man gerade erst vergangenen Dezember den Zins von 1% auf 2% angehoben habe. “Wir sind damit nach wie vor eine der wenigen Großbanken in Deutschland, die nennenswerte Zinsen für bestehende Konten beim Tagesgeld zahlen.”\n\nWer investieren will, sollte investieren\nMit seinen 2% Zinsen lässt Trade Republic gerade nicht nur die gesamte deutsche Brokerlandschaft, sondern auch viele Banken blass aussehen. Das Angebot ist überdurchschnittlich gut. So gut, dass es den ein oder anderen Anleger von seinem Ziel ablenken könnte. Gerade jetzt, da in vielen Depots die roten Zahlen dominieren, können so ein paar risikofreie 2% toll klingen. Wer sein Geld aber langfristig gewinnbringend anlegen möchte und dabei eher an 5-7% jährliche Rendite dachte, sollte auch dabei bleiben. Ja, die Stimmung an der Börse ist gerade betrübt und niemand weiß, ob es mit den Kursen der Welt-Indizes in den kommenden Monaten nicht noch weiter runtergehen wird. Trotzdem wird es sich langfristig auszahlen, auch in schlechten und extrem unwägbaren Situationen Geld am Aktienmarkt zu investieren. Gerade für solche Anleger, die noch 15, 20 oder mehr Jahr vor sich haben. Besser wäre es also, das Zinsangebot als das zu nehmen, was es ist: Ein nettes Zusatzangebot, das den ein oder anderen kleineren Betrag einbringen wird – aber keine solide Rendite, mit der sich das eigene Vermögen merklich vergrößern lässt.\""}]}

The utility’s area spans 4,100 square miles. Exceptional customer service is a priority of SDG&amp;E as it seeks to enhance the region's quality of life. SDG&amp;E is a regulated subsidiary of Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE). Sempra Energy, based in San Diego, is a Fortune 500 energy services holding company.\n\n1.2.\tEPIC Project Background \nThe California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) established the Electric Program Investment Charge (“EPIC”) to assist the development of non-commercialized new and emerging clean energy technologies in California while providing assistance to commercially viable projects. EPIC consists of three program areas: (1) Applied research and development; (2) Technology demonstration and deployment; and (3) Market facilitation, consisting of market research, regulatory permitting and streamlining, and workforce development activities. EPIC activities must be designed to produce electricity ratepayer benefits for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (“SDG&amp;E”), Pacific Gas and Electric (“PG&amp;E”), and Southern California Edison (“SCE”) customers. The annual EPIC budget of $162 million is collected from customers in electric utility bills at the following levels: PG&amp;E (50.1%), SCE (41.1%), and SDG&amp;E (8.8%). \nThe California Energy Commission (“CEC”) administers 80% of the funding with the ability to invest in all of the approved EPIC activities; SDG&amp;E, PG&amp;E and SCE administer 20% of the funding with funding shares proportional to their respective collections and are limited to investing only in pre-commercial technology demonstrations. Of the 20% administered by the utilities, SDG&amp;E’s share is only 1.76%. A portion of this 1.76% will be used to fund this project. Note that pre-commercial demonstrations must be for existing solutions and cannot be used for the development of new technology. . Links to each of the EPIC investment plans and the CPUC Decisions authorizing their execution and establishing programmatic requirements are on SDG&amp;E’s public website:\nhttps://www.sdge.com/epic\n\n\n1.3.\tRFP Objective and Purpose\nThe objective of this RFP is to select one or more contractors for the development of a Virtual Reality (“VR”) precommercial training simulator for Personal Protective Grounding/Equal Potential Zones (“PPG/EPZ”) on the electric distribution underground (“UG”) system. \n\nThe purpose of this RFP is to solicit competitive bids to furnish and deliver certain services to Company, as further described herein. The information submitted in response to this RFP will be used to identify and evaluate Bidders who can provide, among other things, the most effective capabilities, quality, customer service to SDG&amp;E, and competitive prices for the services performed.\n\n1.4.\tRFP Scope\nThis new training simulator will guide  one or more students using wireless VR googles with virtual hands  through five different scenarios. If VR goggles are not available, a student should be able to complete the training in two dimensions. The simulator should be able to assist the student through the five scenarios, test them on each scenario and retain records that the participant completed the training. The expected deliverables to be bidare:\n1.\tFive (5)  story boards total: one for each scenario \n2.\tA two dimensional training simulator for each scenario\n3.\tA virtual reality for each scenario\n4.\tA learning management system (LMS) for each  scenario\n\n\nFive (5) Different Scenarios:\n\n1.\tReplacing an elbow in a handhole with jacketed cable.\n\n2.\tReplacing a run of cable between two handholes with jacketed cable.   \n\n3.\tReplacing a “T” in a handhole with unjacketed and jacketed cable.\n\n4.\tReplacing a live front piece of equipment to a dead front with unjacketed cable.\n\n5.\tChanging a switch in a manhole.\"\n\nThe proposal should be at least 2000 words long."}]}

This cap is then divided into permits that can be traded among companies that emit carbon. Companies that can reduce emissions below the allocated level can sell unused permits to companies that cannot do so, creating a market-based incentive for emissions reductions. Cap-and-trade schemes are designed to create market-driven incentives for companies to invest in green technologies and reduce carbon emissions. In the context of the renewable energy industry, carbon emissions trading can encourage investment in clean energy as companies seek to reduce carbon emissions and obtain licenses for future transactions.\nCarbon pricing mechanisms, including carbon trading schemes, can play a key role in attracting private investment in the renewable energy sector, which is critical to meeting global climate goals, according to a World Bank report. The report states that “carbon pricing is an effective tool to guide capital for low-carbon investment, incentivize technological innovation, and help reduce emissions in the most cost-effective manner.” Carbon trading creates opportunities for companies to reduce carbon emissions by allowing them to sell unused allowances. This creates financial incentives, which in turn reduces the overall cost of abatement and promotes more efficient resource allocation.\nThe success of carbon trading schemes depends on a variety of factors, such as the initial allocation of emission allowances, the stability of carbon prices, and the effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. A study by the International Monetary Fund found that \"well-designed carbon pricing systems can help governments generate revenue, encourage private sector investment in clean technologies, and help address climate change in a cost-effective manner.\" The study also noted that carbon pricing schemes It can help countries meet their climate goals, such as those set out in the Paris Agreement, and foster international cooperation on climate change."}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "summarize this =&gt; ompanies have long sensed the potential\nvalue of investing in external start-ups. More\noften than not, though, they just can’t seem to\nget it right.\nRecall the mad dash to invest in new ventures in the\nlate 1990s – and then the hasty retreat as the economy\nturned. Nearly one-third of the companies actively in-\nvesting corporate funds in start-ups in September 2000\nhad stopped making such investments 12 months later,\naccording to the research firm Venture Economics, and\nduring the same period, the amount of corporate money\ninvested in start-ups fell by 80%. This decline in invest-\nments was part of a historic pattern of advance and re-\ntreat, but the swings in recent years were even wider than\nbefore: Quarterly corporate venture-capital investments\nin start-ups rose from $468 million at the end of 1998 to\n$6.2 billion at the beginning of 2000 and then tumbled\nto $848 million in the third quarter of 2001. While private\nVC investments also ebb and flow as the economy\nchanges, the shifts in corporate VC investments have been\nparticularly dramatic.\nof Corporate\nL\nVenture\nCapital\nMaking Sense\nby Henry W. Chesbrough\nCompanies have, at best, a mixed\nrecord funding start-ups. A new\nframework, simple in design but\npowerful in application, can help\nidentify the investments that will\nyield a return that matters –\nstrategic growth.\nSuch inconsistent behavior certainly contributes to the\nlow regard with which many private venture capitalists\nview in-house corporate VC operations. In their eyes, the\nwild swings are further evidence that big companies have\nneither the stomach nor the agility to manage invest-\nments in high-risk, fast-paced environments. They also\npoint to some high-profile missteps by individual compa-\nnies to support this conclusion. Those missteps have,\nin turn, tended to make some companies hesitant to\nlaunch programs to invest in external start-ups, even in\ngood times.\nA number of companies, however, have defied this\nstereotype of the bumbling corporate behemoth and have\ncontinued to make investments in new ventures. Even as\nsubstantial numbers of corporate venture capitalists have\nheaded for the exits in the past year and a half, some big\ncompanies – including Intel, Microsoft, and Qualcomm –\nhave publicly committed themselves to continued high\nlevels of investment. Others – such as Merck, Lilly, and\nMillennium Pharmaceuticals – have actually come in the\ndoor as others have left. What gives these optimists their\nconfidence? More generally, why have some companies’\nforays into venture capital been successful, generating\nsignificant growth for their own businesses?\nTo answer these questions, we need an orga-\nnized way to think about corporate venture capi-\ntal, a framework that can help a company decide\nwhether it should invest in a particular start-up\nby first understanding what kind of benefit might\nbe realized from the investment. This article offers\nsuch a framework, one that also suggests when –\nthat is, in what kind of economic climates – differ-\nent types of investment are likely to make sense.\nBut first, let’s briefly define corporate venture\ncapital. We use the term to describe the invest-\nment of corporate funds directly in external start-up\ncompanies. Our definition excludes investments made\nthrough an external fund managed by a third party, even\nif the investment vehicle is funded by and specifically\ndesigned to meet the objectives of a single investing com-\npany. It also excludes investments that fall under the\nmore general rubric of “corporate venturing” – for exam-\nple, the funding of new internal ventures that, while dis-\ntinct from a company’s core business and granted some\norganizational autonomy, remain legally part of the com-\npany. Our definition does include, however, investments\nmade in start-ups that a company has already spun off as\nindependent businesses.\nOur framework helps explain why certain types of cor-\nporate VC investments proliferate only when financial\nreturns are high, why other types persist in good times\nand in bad, and why still others make little sense in any\nphase of the business cycle. It can also help companies\nevaluate their existing and potential VC investments and\ndetermine when and how to use corporate VC as an in-\nstrument of strategic growth. The Dual Dimensions\nof Corporate VC\nA corporate VC investment is defined by two characteris-\ntics: its objective and the degree to which the operations\nof the investing company and the start-up are linked. Al-\nthough companies typically have a range of objectives for\ntheir VC investments, this type of funding usually ad-\nvances one of two fundamental goals. Some investments\nare strategic: They are made primarily to increase the\nsales and profits of the corporation’s own businesses. A\ncompany making a strategic investment seeks to identify\nand exploit synergies between itself and a new venture.\nFor example, Lucent Venture Partners, which invests the\ntelecommunications equipment maker’s funds in exter-\nnal companies, makes investments in start-ups that are\nfocused on infrastructure or services for voice or data net-\nworks. Many of these companies have formal alliances\nwith Lucent to help sell Lucent’s equipment alongside\ntheir own offerings. While Lucent would clearly like to\nmake money on its investments in these start-ups, it is\nwilling to accept low returns if its own businesses perform\nbetter as a result of the investments.\nThe other investment objective is financial, wherein a\ncompany is mainly looking for attractive returns. Here,\na corporation seeks to do as well as or better than private\nVC investors, due to what it sees as its superior knowledge\nof markets and technologies, its strong balance sheet, and\nits ability to be a patient investor. In addition, a company’s\nbrand may signal the quality of the start-up to other in-\nvestors and potential customers, ultimately returning\nrewards to the original investor. For example, Dell Ven-\ntures, Dell Computer’s in-house VC operation, has made\nnumerous Internet investments that it has expected to\nearn attractive returns. While the company hopes that\nthe investments will help its own business grow, the main\nmarch 2002 5\nM a k i n g S e n s e o f Co r p o rat e Ve n t u re Ca p i ta l\nHenry W. Chesbrough is an assistant professor of business\nadministration and the Class of 1961 Fellow at Harvard Busi-\nness School in Boston. He can be reached at hchesbrough@\nhbs.edu.\nOur framework can help companies evaluate\ntheir existing and potential VC investments and\ndetermine when and how to use corporate VC\nas an instrument of strategic growth.\nrationale for the investments has been the possibility of\nhigh financial returns.\nThe second defining characteristic of corporate VC\ninvestments is the degree to which companies in the in-\nvestment portfolio are linked to the investing company’s\ncurrent operational capabilities – that is, its resources and\nprocesses. For example, a start-up with strong links to the\ninvesting company might make use of that company’s\nmanufacturing plants, distribution channels, technology,\nor brand. It might adopt the investing company’s business\npractices to build, sell, or\nservice its products.\nSometimes, of course, a\ncompany’s own resources\nand processes can become\nliabilities rather than capa-\nbilities, particularly when\nit faces new markets or dis-\nruptive technologies.1 An\nexternal venture may offer\nthe investing company an\nopportunity to build new\nand different capabilities – ones that could threaten the\nviability of current corporate capabilities. Housing these\ncapabilities in a separate legal entity can insulate them\nfrom internal efforts to undermine them. If the venture\nand its processes fare well, the corporation can then eval-\nuate whether and how to adapt its own processes to be\nmore like those of the start-up. In rare cases, the company\nmay even decide to acquire the venture."}]}

last few lessons we talked about setting up a niche we talked about finding a problem to solve we talked about pricing we talked about location dependence and now this is the final step in what you need to do to create your location independent high income low work alpha two penal business and what's interesting is that most guys or women when they start a business they focus on this step first and this is actually the last step and that is to set up a delivery system so delivery system means two things it means how do you deliver the solution that you're offering to the client or customer if that's a service if that's an ebook if that's a course if that's an information product consulting coaching whatever it is okay whatever it is we cover in one of the last videos right how do we deliver that to the customer or client location independent without having to be physically located in that city and if you say well i have to be physically located in that city in order to deliver that thing then either you don't sell that thing or you rejigger that service or thing to make it so you can deliver that service and i've done both these things i have said no to a lot of business opportunities over the past 25 years of my life i've had a lot of interesting offers to get involved with certain people certain companies that probably would have made money but they were location dependent they required me to stay in a certain city so i said no because my freedom is more important than any business model so i'm going to be location dependent for the rest of my life thank you very much and there were other scenarios where most guys would have assumed they were location dependent but instead they weren't for example here's an easy one toward the end of my computer consulting career that's my first business that i started when i was a kid in my mid-20s toward the end of that what i started doing is i realized location dependence was important to me so if my clients wanted me to work really hardcore on a computer or a new computer or a para computer or what have you what i would have them do especially if it was a new computer is i would have them ship the computer to me usually was a laptop so it wasn't a big deal ship it to me overnight i would work on it that day ship it back the next day overnight they'd have it back within two days and it was all set ready to go that worked really really well and there are a lot of guys back then this is years ago a lot of guys back then my competitors who would have never done that they said well that wouldn't have worked worked great so there are location dependent services that you can offer in a location independent fashion as long as you think outside the box so delivery system is first how do you deliver the service or product or information to the client or customer that's the delivery system that's the first part the second part of the delivery system is how do you get the money how do you get the money from the client or customer without physically having to be there now this is a lot easier than it used to be and this is a lot easier it used to be in a postcovid world there are all kinds of mechanisms now where you can deliver hard services soft services information all kinds of things where you don't physically have to be there and then obviously you can get the money from the kleiner customer even if it's a lot of money without physically having to be there i do wire transfers all the time for big big big payments because i run three companies matter of fact just last week i did a wire transfer for what it was 20 000 to a company i do business with internationally and i didn't have to physically be there i'm set up on my online banking to do my own wire transfer so i don't to call a bank every time like most people do because again i'm location independent so this is your delivery system location independent that's the name of the game and if it's not location dependent if the client says i have to give you a check there are still people out there like this matter of fact my wife was just working with a person a little while ago and he was like no i only pay via check if they insist on paying checks you don't do business if it's an old school industry that insists on physically handing you a piece of paper for something you don't do business or you don't do that kind of business everything must be location dependent both the delivery system to the client and the payment system from the client or customer cool now again what most people do when they start a business is this is the first step they go okay i gotta set up a website and i gotta set up a way to you know email the stuff and i gotta set up a check account a paypal account and i gotta set up a merchant account and they do this before they've identified a niche before they've identified a problem before in many cases they even priced out their product or made an offer no this is the final step before you start hardcore marketing which we talked about in the last lesson this is it this is not the first step it's the last step and i have to reiterate that because if you are a more intelligent person higher iq person college educated person what you're going to want to do is focus a lot of time on this no this is the last step before you market the more important steps the ones we already covered in the prior videos especially establishing a niche and structuring your business first then you do this now if you want help with setting up your own location independent business where we actually hold your hand and walk you through the process the 90 day business builder you have access to that now for probably the lowest price it will ever be we will actually over

coaches depends who you get where there's only a limited time in which you could schedule these calls then we close the window because we only can take on a certain number of people into the program

schedule that call it is free you can get all your questions answered we'll go through all the details of how it works if it's not for you that is perfectly fine but if it is for you this could change your life location independent income is the springboard to everything else i talk about in all my other content if you're familiar with my content sovereign ceo moving out of the country getting residencies and passports in other countries living a more free lifestyle avoiding western collapse all that stuff the bedrock foundation of all that is location independent income because if you don't have location dependent income how are you going to move how you're going to leave the country how you be mobile pretty difficult unless you have a lot of money and savings so if you're a lot of money savings and you probably do it for a while and then you need income again don't you this is the cheapest it will ever be it will never be less expensive than this because the next time we do

Dekart is similar to Kepler.gl and build on top of Kepler.gl. Main difference with Kepler.gl is that it Dekart implements backend to host created reports. Kepler.gl is client only. Dekart is integrated with BigQuery and Amazon Athena. Dekart interface allows writing SQL to extract and transform data for reports, similar to other BI tools like Redash. Once data fetched user can create maps via Kepler like UI.\n\nOur personal goal is to grow open source project until business opportunity become evident to attract significant investment like series A. Alternatively is to bootstrap SaaS until it generates revenue which let us quit our day jobs.\n\nCurrently main competitors are:\n* open source Kepler.gl\n* Unfolded.ai created by authors of Kepler.gl and acquired by Foursquare\n* CartoDB which pivots from SaaS for developers to SaaS for GIS professionals and Data Scientists  and competes with ArcGIS\n\nWe see two potential path for development:\n* copy functionality of Unfolded.ai and CartoDB to Dekart open source projects which can deployed on premise by customers. Discover which niche can we occupy, for example we can optimize product for companies selling location datasets. Currently this companies are one of the main users, however their use case is not clear\n* second option is to focus on original vision for Dekart: implement  analytic tool capable to fetch and visualize vast amount of datapoints. Our benchmark could be to support at least 1 million points for any visualization. This vision is inspired by our experience to analyze IoT and mobility data stored on company Lake House. Existing tools like Redash, Superset, Metabase are not capable to visualize over 100 thousands points and missing GIS visualizations. We could validate this strategy by publishing BI tools benchmarks and collecting users feedback.\n\nAsk follow up questions and when have enough information, suggest 100 days plan."}]}
