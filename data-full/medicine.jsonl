{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "From now on you are an expert Data Scientist skilled in Natural Language Processing and your domain of work is healthcare. You are tasked with designing a machine learning app to identify Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) from medical notes. You will only list the steps at a very high level and not give out any programming code. Assume that the relevant text is extracted from medical notes and presented to your application, also assume model deployment and serving is already done. Only list the design steps to identify SDoH and extract them and rate a person based on the SDoH factors.Here are the high-level steps I would take to design a machine learning app to identify Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) from medical notes:Data collection: Collect a large dataset of medical notes that contain information about patients' SDoH. This could include information about patients' socio-economic status, education level, housing, transportation, access to food and healthcare, and other factors that affect health outcomes.Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure that it is in a format that can be used for training the machine learning model. This might involve removing any irrelevant information, standardizing formatting, and tokenizing the text.Feature engineering: Extract relevant features from the medical notes to be used as input for the machine learning model. These might include, for example, the presence of certain keywords or phrases that are known to be associated with specific SDoH, or the presence of certain demographics or comorbidities.Model training: Train a machine learning model, such as a deep learning model like LSTM/CNN, or transformer based model like BERT/ALBERT, using the processed and feature engineered data. This model will learn to predict the presence of specific SDoH based on the input data.Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure that it is able to accurately identify SDoH from medical notes.Scoring and rating based on the SDoH factors: Extract the SDoH factors identified by the model, along with their predicted probabilities, from the medical notes. Using these factors and their probabilities, assign a score or rating to each patient indicating the level of risk they have for specific SDoH-related health outcomes.Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a REST API service and wrap it with a simple UI to allow non-technical end-users to interact with it.Note: Many NLP pre-trained models are now publicly available, so re-training can be avoided and can be fine-tuned with a smaller labeled dataset to identify SDoH.How will you gather the data to build above model, how will you annotate the data for SDoH factorsTo gather data to build the machine learning model, I would use a variety of methods, including:Electronic health records (EHRs): Many hospitals and clinics have large datasets of patient information stored in EHR systems that can be used for research purposes. This data can be accessed with appropriate permissions and de-identified to protect patient privacy.Surveys and questionnaires: Collect data from patients through surveys and questionnaires that ask about their SDoH. This data can be collected either in-person or through online platforms.Publicly available datasets: There are many publicly available datasets that contain information about SDoH and health outcomes, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).To annotate the data for SDoH factors, I would use a process called \"data annotation.\" This would involve identifying specific pieces of information in the medical notes that correspond to SDoH factors, and labeling them accordingly. The process of annotation can be done in a few ways:Manual annotation: Annotators would manually read through the medical notes and identify and label SDoH factors.Semi-automatic annotation: Annotators would use a tool that suggests possible SDoH factors based on the text, and then manually verify and label the factors.Automatic annotation: A pre-trained model can be used to identify SDoH factors automatically, and a human annotator can verify the predictions.The choice of the annotation method would depend on the budget, data volume and time available for the project.Note: The annotation process could be time-consuming and labor-intensive, so it's worth considering options to outsource the task or use pre-trained models for annotation.Please suggest a pre-trained model for identifying SDoH There are several pre-trained models that could be used for identifying Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) from medical notes, depending on the specific task and the type of data you have. Here are a few examples:BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): BERT is a transformer-based pre-trained model that can be fine-tuned for a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification and named entity recognition. It could be fine-tuned on the SDoH related data to identify the factors from the medical notes.ALBERT (A Lite BERT): ALBERT is a variation of BERT that is optimized for smaller-scale models, it reduces the number of parameters to improve the performance on limited computational resources.DistilBERT: DistilBERT is a smaller version of BERT that is trained to retain the performance of BERT with a smaller number of parameters, it's more efficient to fine-tune on a smaller dataset.SciBERT: SciBERT is a pre-trained model fine-tuned on scientific literature and it could be used to extract domain-specific SDoH factors.ClinicalBERT: ClinicalBERT is pre-trained on large amount of clinical notes and could be fine-tuned on SDoH data to extract the factors from clinical notes.These are just a few examples, but other pre-trained models, such as RoBERTa, XLNet, and GPT-2, could also be used for identifying SDoH from medical notes. Keep in mind that the choice of model will depend on the availability of computational resources, the specific SDoH factors you're trying to identify, and the quality and quantity of your annotated data.design and develop a model in python using spaCy package leveraging Clinical BERT to fine-tune on SDoH data. This model will learn to predict the presence of specific SDoH based on the input data and rate it. Here are the high-level steps I would take to design and develop a model in Python using the spaCy package and the ClinicalBERT pre-trained model to fine-tune it on SDoH data:Installation: Install the spaCy package and any other required dependencies. Also, you need to install the pre-trained ClinicalBERT model to utilize it.Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected SDoH data to ensure that it is in a format that can be used for fine-tuning the pre-trained model. This might involve removing any irrelevant information, standardizing formatting, and tokenizing the text.Load the pre-trained ClinicalBERT model : Utilize the pre-trained ClinicalBERT model and load it into spaCy.Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the pre-trained model on the SDoH data by training the model on the labeled SDoH data. This can be done by spaCy's language model pipeline feature.Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure that it is able to accurately identify SDoH from medical notes.Scoring and rating based on the SDoH factors: Extract the SDoH factors identified by the model, along with their predicted probabilities, from the medical notes. Using these factors and their probabilities, assign a score or rating to each patient indicating the level of risk they have for specific SDoH-related health outcomes.Model deployment: To make the model easily accessible to end-users, it can be deployed as a REST API service, for example using Flask, or a command line interface (CLI) tool.This is a high-level overview, depending on the complexity of the data, preprocessing, and the problem statement, there may be more steps required in the process and the details of the steps might differ.\nIt is good to mention that the computational resources required to fine-tune the pre-trained ClinicalBERT model could be significant, so it's worth considering options to run the training on a cluster of machines with GPUs.For determining SDoH data will you use Named Entity Recognition or classification, explain you decisionDetermining Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) data from medical notes can be done using either Named Entity Recognition (NER) or classification. The choice between the two will depend on the specific task and the type of data that you have.Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities, such as person names, organizations, and locations, in text. NER can be used to identify specific SDoH factors, such as patient's occupation, housing, income, and education, in medical notes by training the model to recognize entities that are relevant to SDoH and labeling them accordingly.Classification, on the other hand, is a method of categorizing data into predefined classes. For SDoH, it involves training a model to predict the presence of specific SDoH factors, such as low income, poor housing, lack of transportation, etc., based on the input data. The model would be trained on labeled data, where each sample is associated with one or more SDoH factors.My decision would depend on the structure of the data, the task and the amount of labeled data available. If the data is well-structured and a fair amount of labeled data is available, a classification approach could work well. But, if the data is unstructured, has less labeled data and the task is to extract specific SDoH factors from the medical notes, NER approach would be a better fit.In the scenario where we are using the pre-trained models like ClinicalBERT, the pre-trained model already is good at the NER task, and fine-tuning the model on SDoH data could make the model better at identifying the SDoH factors directly.What are most key factors in determining SDoH which can be found in medical notesThere are many factors that can be used to determine Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) from medical notes, but some key factors include:Socio-economic status: Factors such as income, occupation, and education level can provide insight into a patient's socio-economic status and can be used to infer their risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes.Housing: Information about a patient's housing, such as whether they own or rent their home, the condition of the home, and whether it is overcrowded, can provide insight into the patient's risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes.Access to healthcare: Information about a patient's access to healthcare, such as whether they have health insurance, the type of insurance they have, and whether they have a regular healthcare provider, can provide insight into the patient's risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes.Transportation: Information about a patient's transportation, such as whether they have access to a car, the availability of public transportation, and the distance they live from their healthcare provider, can provide insight into the patient's risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes.Food security: Information about a patient's access to food, such as whether they have enough to eat, whether they have access to healthy food options, and whether they experience food insecurity, can provide insight into the patient's risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes.Social Support: Information about a patient's social support system such as family, friends and community, can provide insight into the patient's risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes.Demographics: The patient's age, gender, and race/ethnicity can also be important factors in determining their risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes.Comorbidities: The patient's history of chronic diseases, mental health conditions, medication and treatment history can also be important factors in determining their risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes.It's important to note that these are just a few examples, and different SDoH factors may be more relevant for different populations or in different settings. Identifying relevant SDoH factors for a specific population and use case may require additional research and exploration.You did not mention addiction to smoking, alcohol, marital status etc. which are key factors for SDoH, can you list similar factors apart from what you have listed alreadyYes, you're correct that addiction to smoking, alcohol, and marital status are important Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) factors that can have a significant impact on health outcomes. Here are some additional factors that can be used to determine SDoH from medical notes:Addiction to smoking and alcohol: Information about a patient's addiction to smoking and alcohol can provide insight into their risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes, such as lung cancer, heart disease, and liver disease.Marital status: Information about a patient's marital status can provide insight into their risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes. For example, being married has been shown to be associated with better health outcomes in many cases.Childcare: Information about a patient's childcare can provide insight into their risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes. For example, lack of access to affordable childcare can be a barrier to parents working, which can lead to poverty and lack of access to healthcare.Employment status: Information about a patient's employment status can provide insight into their risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes. For example, unemployment can lead to poverty and lack of access to healthcare.Neighborhood characteristics: Information about a patient's neighborhood, such as crime rate, housing density, and access to green space can provide insight into their risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes.Immigration status: Information about a patient's immigration status can provide insight into their risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes. For example, immigrants may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to language barriers, lack of knowledge of the healthcare system and lack of insurance coverage.Language: Information about a patient's primary language can provide insight into their risk for certain SDoH-related health outcomes. For example, patients who speak languages other than English may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to language barriers, lack of knowledge of the healthcare system and lack of insurance coverage.These factors can provide additional information to help identify SDoH and their impact on patients’ health outcomes. It's important to note that different factors may be more relevant for different populations or in different settings and identifying relevant SDoH factors for a specific population and use case may require additional research and exploration."}]}

you have four board certifications one of which is sleep medicine so you spend a lot of time researching how light impacts us as human beings and i know you're very excited about this topic the average american spends 93 of our life indoors that's 87 of our life is inside buildings and another six percent on average inside automobiles so tell us why you're so excited about this topic and are we going to get some practical tips that we can implement right away yeah thanks kyle i became excited about this because as i started to learn about what scientists are discovering it was mind-blowing i mean we know about ultraviolet radiation from the sun and its role in producing vitamin d in our bodies but there's a whole other aspect to the light that we get from the sun and light that comes outside for instance the visible spectrum and how it affects us the infrared spectrum and how it affects us we are now starting to see what scientists are finding is amazing and beyond the science of this which we'll talk about we're going to give you practical tips to harness that information and actually apply it to your body so that you can help optimize your immune system and as you'll see the results of that can also help in things like covet 19 and and general infections but the information in this video i believe is so important that everybody needs to be able to understand this and that's the reason why i'm so excited to talk to you about light so to explain why light is so important to the human body we've got to get down to the cellular level and explain this sort of at the outset and to do that i'm going to use an analogy to help explain what i'm talking about so in every cell of our bodies we have something called mitochondria are like the engine in a car it produces the power the energy and for the body it produces atp which is the currency of energy for our body but just like the engine in your car it can overheat and it can shut down and that's a byproduct of what it does and it's a very similar situation that happens in the mitochondria the mitochondria takes the food that you eat the fats the proteins the carbohydrates and it makes the atp that your body needs but a byproduct of that is oxidative stress that's the heat around the engine that if the oxidative stress builds up too much it can cause problems so what are some problems you can run into if you have too much oxidative stress what scientists have discovered and looked at over the years is that there are a lot of consequences to oxidative stress less optimal health inflammation cancer dementia diabetes and learning disabilities have been tied to oxidative stress in the mitochondria and mitochondrial disability okay so mitochondria are in all of our cells and you've given the analogy that they're like a car that they can overheat and have problems so a car's got a cooling system what would be the cooling system if you will in our mitochondria so actually the body has two different systems to be put in place that takes care of the mitochondria in terms of cooling it down or getting rid of the oxidative stress in the mitochondria depending on whether it's day or night and i think that's fascinating many of us know about what the cooling system is at night because we've heard of it before and one of the things that is done is that melatonin which is one of the strongest antioxidants that has been studied it actually up regulates the glutathione system is twice as powerful as vitamin e melatonin is secreted at night from the pineal gland goes into the blood circulation goes into the cells and is actively transported in and then goes into the mitochondria to fulfill its duty to mop up very efficiently these oxidative stress molecules okay let me see if i'm following this so in the evening melatonin's released from the pineal gland and we've all heard that melatonin can help us sleep people take melatonin as a sleep supplement i know it's important for that but you're saying it also goes into the mitochondria of our cells and combats oxidative stress that's exactly correct okay so that process works at night how do mitochondria in our cells deal with oxidative stress during the day well that's a very good question because any type of light that hits the human eye is going to shut down the production of melatonin from the pineal gland and so there has to be a completely different system that is put in place during the day that allows melatonin to be made in the mitochondria to deal with the oxidative stress remember we said that these hydroxy radicals these oxygen radicals that are produced in the mitochondria as a result of metabolism can destroy things immediately in its vicinity so you need to have antioxidants right there on site and so the question is is exactly how does this happen during the day and the answer is that infrared radiation from the sun which we'll talk about actually goes into the mitochondria and is producing melatonin on-site this is what the science is now starting to discover making it very interesting as to how much sunlight are we getting and what happens when we don't get enough sunlight so is oxidative stress always bad for us no oxidative stress can actually be beneficial if it's in the right place so oxidative stress in the mitochondria is just going to serve to break down the proteins of the electron transport change which we'll talk about as we get into this lecture but it's very important for cells for instance like white blood cells which are responsible for killing bacteria to have within them the ability to have oxidative bursts and oxidative stress so in certain places at certain times oxidative stress can be very beneficial but in the mitochondria no the body needs systems in place to protect the mitochondria because it's doing a very important work many of us have heard that not all light from the sun is visible light so can you break down the solar spectrum for us yeah kyle let's take a look at the solar spectrum which looks at the energy coming from the sun sometimes i don't like to use the word light but i will use it because it assumes that light is something that we can see but clearly there is energy coming from the sun which we cannot see and that's important to understand as we look here at the solar spectrum you'll see that 39 just 39 of the energy coming from the sun is in the form of visible light and we can see that here between 400 nanometers and 760 nanometers wavelength we'll talk about wavelength and so you can see everything to the right of red is known as infrared because it has a wavelength longer than red and that is divided up into near infrared and far infrared we'll talk about this more later don't get too concerned about this b or even more lux so that kind of gives you an idea when we talk about exposing your eyes to light at a certain lux level this is a good reference point for understanding light and its intensity with that information now we're ready to talk about light and how it affects the human body this is going to be divided into two parts the first part is going to be what happens at night how we divide the night from the day and how sleep and the circadian rhythm is affected by light the second part is going to be on how light affects us and this slide here tells exactly how that happens so as you can see here when light hits the eye and specifically goes to the retina and i want to specifically say that we know that light that goes to the retina is hitting rods and cones and those go to neurons which then project back here to the occipital lobe and that's where we actually can understand and visualize and see things what i'm about to talk about is a completely different section of the retina and it does it in a completely different way impact in terms of melatonin secretion or not at night so in other words a fire sitting in front of you it's going to be reflecting on the superior retinal ganglion cells where there's not a lot of these intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and so the melatonin production should still stay relatively good and also as we mentioned fire is typically red oranges and not the type of thing that we would see with blue light etc interestingly also is at sunset when we see sunset the sun is going down in motion the timing of melatonin about 12 to 14 hours later so if cortisol is coming up at around 8 o'clock in the morning then melatonin is going to be coming up at around nine o'clock at night in a perfectly timed circadian rhythm as we talked about but when you have cortisol levels that are not aligned correctly if your circadian rhythm is off cortisol pulses that are shifted later in the day can be correlated with conditions of anxiety and also depressive disorders also bright light is a strong stimulus as red as possible and you want to have it as dim as possible so that you can have the benefit of melatonin secretion from the pineal gland when the time is right remember what we said that intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells are more activated by blue light so if you have no choice if you have to do something it's better to make sure that the blue light aspect is reduced either by programming it into the computer or by wearing blue blockers glasses that really is the two aspects of this portion of the talk where we in addition to nadh there's a small amount of atp and gtp and other reducing agents but the major product of krebs cycle and the metabolism of carbohydrates proteins and fats is to make nadh now nadh is a way of packaging very powerfully reduced electrons so what's interesting now is how the mitochondria take these very reduced electrons and convert them into energy and that's done with something called the electron transport chain the electron transport chain and the electron transport chain is basically a infrared radiation that is the part from 760 nanometers to 1400 nanometers and you cannot see this how you experience near infrared radiation or light from the sun is a feeling of warmth and that is because this type of light from the sun can penetrate deep into the epidermis the dermis and even the subcutaneous tissue depending on the wavelength and it's perceived as heat because the transfer of this energy actually stimulates the heat receptors in our skin and that is how it is felt you'll often feel this right if you're around it because it's able to penetrate through this near infrared radiation not only the eye but also the rest of the body so that what we're seeing is light that is very rich in near infrared radiation and you actually don't even need to be into the sun so being outside in green spaces is a good place to be from a near infrared radiation standpoint that's exactly correct cal kyle take a look at these near infrared photographs you'll see here that it's exactly as i'm talking about you can see here the interesting because here was a study that was done almost a thousand cases of melanoma looked at 513 in the population and 174 sibling controls that were recruited in england and they looked to see what was protective in the relationship between sun exposure and melanoma risk and what they found was very interesting they said quote overall the clearest relationship between reported sun exposure and risk was for average weekend sun exposure in warmer months which was protective in other words if you had weekend sun exposure a lot of reactive oxygen species however at17 is an antioxidant it's going to suppress reactive oxygen species which is good that's what we want to do the problem is is that when the virus infects binds to that ace2 receptor it knocks out that enzyme and so instead of angiotensin ii going down and angiotensin 1-7 going up we have the opposite occur and so what we have is angiotensin ii going up angiotensin 1-7 going down and not only that but the virus itself attracts white blood cells which also has oxidative stress as we the light and warmth of the glorious sun you pale and sickly ones and share with its vegetation its life-giving health dealing power that was from the health reformer back in 1871 she also wrote interestingly because we talked about when it's daylight you need to go out into the sun well what do you do at night she writes make it a habit not to sit up after nine o'clock every light should be extinguished this turning night in today is a wretched health destroying habit you know i'm comparing what happened screens that are very small so i think it's the answer is a qualified yes so speaking of light bulbs what temperature bulb do you recommend people have in their homes so the type of temperature that you need during the waking hours would be something more in the blue spectrum so you know four or five thousand k would be the type of bulb that we're talking about so full spectrum daylight whereas the areas of your home that you go to sleep in those are the types of lights in that area that you'd want to have a in um in the netherlands and in england where over the previous seven day period of time that had changes in the metabolic activity of the body i have to wonder whether or not in covet 19 patients whether we should be advising that they go outside that they get into the sun or at least have indirect sun exposure and i'm looking at those photographs of those hospitals back a hundred years ago and wondering whether or not our coven 19 patients might benefit from some time in the sun as well well dr schwell thank you again for\""}]}

Appelbaum, M.D.\nFrom the Division of Law, Ethics, and Psy\u0002chiatry, Department of Psychiatry, College \nof Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia Uni\u0002versity and New York State Psychiatric \nInstitute, New York. Address correspon\u0002dence to Dr. Appelbaum at the New York \nState Psychiatric Institute, Unit 122, 1051 \nRiverside Dr., New York, NY 10032, or at \npsa21@columbia.edu.\nN Engl J Med 2007;357:1834-40.\nCopyright © 2007 Massachusetts Medical Society. \nA 75-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease is \nadmitted with a gangrenous ulcer of the plantar aspect of her left foot. A surgical con\u0002sultation results in a recommendation for a below-the-knee amputation, but the pa\u0002tient declines the procedure on the grounds that she has lived long enough and wants \nto die with her body intact. Her internist, who has known her for 15 years, is con\u0002cerned that she has been increasingly confused over the past year and now appears to \nbe depressed. How should her physician determine whether her decision is a compe\u0002tent one?\nThe Cl inic a l Problem\nPhysicians are required by law and medical ethics to obtain the informed consent of \ntheir patients before initiating treatment.1 Valid informed consent is premised on the \ndisclosure of appropriate information to a competent patient who is permitted to make \na voluntary choice. When patients lack the competence to make a decision about treat\u0002ment, substitute decision makers must be sought. Hence, the determination of wheth\u0002er patients are competent is critical in striking a proper balance between respecting \nthe autonomy of patients who are capable of making informed decisions and protect\u0002ing those with cognitive impairment.\nAlthough incompetence denotes a legal status that in principle should be deter\u0002mined by a court, resorting to judicial review in every case of suspected impairment \nof capacity would probably bring both the medical and legal systems to a halt. (The \nterms “competence” and “capacity” are used interchangeably in this article, since the \noft-cited distinctions between them — competence is said to refer to legal judgments, \nand capacity to clinical ones — are not consistently reflected in either legal or medical \nusage.) Thus, in most situations there is good reason to continue the traditional prac\u0002tice of having physicians determine patients’ capacity and decide when to seek substi\u0002tuted consent.2 Indeed, statutes regarding advance directives for medical treatment \ngenerally recognize a medical determination of incapacity as the trigger for activating \nthese directives.3 In addition, since consent obtained from an incompetent patient \nis invalid, physicians who do not obtain a substituted decision may be subject to \nclaims of having treated the person without informed consent.1 Physicians must there\u0002fore be aware that their patients may have impaired decision-making capacities, and \nthey must be skilled at evaluating that possibility.\nPatients whose competence is impaired are commonly found in medical and surgi\u0002cal inpatient units, and less frequently in outpatient clinics. Between 3 and 25% of \nrequests for psychiatric consultation in hospital settings involve questions about pa\u0002tients’ competence to make treatment-related decisions.4,5 In many other cases, im\u0002paired decision making in hospitalized patients may go undetected,6-9 even when \nThis Journal feature begins with a case vignette highlighting a common clinical problem. \nEvidence supporting various strategies is then presented, followed by a review of formal guidelines, \nwhen they exist. The article ends with the author’s clinical recommendations. \nThe New England Journal of Medicine \nDownloaded from nejm.org at DUQUESNE UNIVERSITY on January 4, 2023. For personal use only.

This \ngroup included patients with a broad array of \nmedical conditions, but most commonly neuro\u0002logic and infectious diseases. The clinical team \nresponsible for these patients had identified only \napproximately one quarter of this group as being \nimpaired.11\nAny diagnosis or treatment that compromises \nmentation may be associated with incompetence. \nHowever, since a range of severity is associated \nwith most diagnoses, no diagnosis in which con\u0002sciousness is retained is invariably predictive of \nincapacity. Data on the diagnostic and other clini\u0002cal predictors of incapacity are derived from stud\u0002ies of decisions regarding both consent to receive \ntreatment and consent to participate in clinical \nresearch. Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and \nother dementias have high rates of incompetence \nwith regard to such decisions; more than half of \npatients with mild-to-moderate dementia may have \nimpairment, and incompetence is universal among \npatients with more severe dementia.12 Stroke can \naffect the capacity to make decisions, depending \non the location and size of the affected area of \nthe brain.13 Among psychiatric disorders, schizo\u0002phrenia has a stronger association with impaired \ncapacity than depression; roughly 50% of patients \nhospitalized with an acute episode of schizophre\u0002nia have impairment with regard to at least one \nelement of competence, as compared with 20 to \n25% of patients admitted with depression.14,15 Less \nsevere depression, treated on an outpatient basis, \nmay not impair capacity at all.16 Patients with \nsymptomatic bipolar disorder may have levels of \nimpairment in decision making that are similar \nto those of patients with schizophrenia.17 Among \npsychiatric patients, lack of insight (the lack of \nawareness of illness and the need for treatment) \nhas been reported to be the strongest predictor of \nincapacity.18\nIn the absence of accompanying cognitive im\u0002pairment, medical conditions such as unstable \nangina,19 diabetes mellitus,20 and human immu\u0002nodeficiency virus infection21 have not been found \nto be associated with an incapacity for decision \nmaking. However, a group of outpatients with \ncancer had quite variable performance on compe\u0002tence assessments,22 with impairment in decision \nmaking correlated with older age, fewer years of \neducation, and cognitive impairment; these data \nunderscore the need to be attentive to limitations \nin capacity in every patient group.\nIntensive care units8 and nursing homes23,24\ninclude substantial proportions of incompetent \npatients. Measures of neuropsychological impair\u0002ment are among the strongest predictors of lim\u0002ited capacity,25 although the specific cognitive \nfunctions that correlate most strongly with impair\u0002ment in decision making vary across diagnostic \ngroups (e.g., patterns in schizophrenia differ from \nthose in Alzheimer’s disease)."}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide an introduction paragraph for the article below.\n\nImproving your heart health is essential for living a healthy life. The heart is the organ that provides oxygen and nutrients to all the tissues in your body, so keeping it in good shape is crucial. Here are X ways to quickly and naturally improve your heart health.\n\nIncrease your dietary fiber intake. Fiber can help you feel fuller, lower cholesterol levels, and improve overall health. Good sources of fiber include beans, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\nLower your daily sodium intake. Consuming too much sodium can cause your body to retain water, which puts extra strain on your heart. To reduce your sodium intake, choose foods labeled \"no salt added,\" avoid foods with more than 400 milligrams of sodium per serving, and aim to stay below 1500 milligrams total per day. Instead of using salt in your cooking, try using herbs and spices. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is also a good way to lower sodium and improve heart health.\nLower your saturated fat intake. Saturated fats can contribute to atherosclerosis, a condition in which plaque builds up in the arteries. You can reduce your intake of saturated fats by eating low-fat cuts of meat, such as the eye of round roast or sirloin tip, and avoiding high-fat dairy products. In general, greasy foods are likely to be higher in saturated fats.\nChoose heart-healthy fats. Unsaturated fats can be beneficial for your heart health by reducing inflammation in the body. Inflammation is a risk factor for heart disease. Heart-healthy fats include vegetable oil, low-fat mayonnaise, and oil-based salad dressings. Adopting a Mediterranean diet is a delicious way to incorporate healthier fats into your diet and lower cholesterol.\nEat lots of fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are full of nutrients and are lower in calories, which can help you maintain a healthy weight and reduce inflammation. The fresher and more colorful your choices, the better. A study of 326 middle-aged adults with no known preexisting heart disease found that consuming a diet rich in fruits and vegetables for eight weeks significantly reduced biomarkers associated with heart cell damage and strain. The study, which compared the effects of a control diet, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and the heart-healthy DASH diet, found that the two diets that were rich in fruits and vegetables had no effect on markers of inflammation. The study was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\nEat low-fat dairy products. Low-fat dairy products are a healthier alternative to high-fat options. Some examples include skim milk, low-fat yogurt, soy milk, and fat-free cheeses.\nGet enough exercise each week. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week or 75 minutes of vigorous activity. Mixing moderate and vigorous activity is also acceptable.\nDon't neglect resistance training. Resistance training activities, such as lifting weights or using resistance bands, can boost your metabolism, help you maintain a healthy weight, and lower blood pressure.\nSpend less time sitting. Standing, walking, and moving around are all better for your heart health than sitting for long periods of time. Use a standing desk or take regular daily walk breaks. The AHA warns that physical inactivity is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and premature death.\nDon't smoke. Smoking is harmful to your heart health. If you smoke, now is a good time to try quitting. You can call 1-800-QUIT-NOW to access a 24/hour quitline with resources to help you quit smoking.\nAvoid secondhand smoke. Being exposed to secondhand smoke also puts your heart health at risk. If someone in your household smokes, ask them to smoke outside or encourage them to quit.\nAvoid excess alcohol intake. Drinking alcohol in excess can increase your risk of heart disease. It's important to drink in moderation. The Department of Health and Human Services recommends no more than 2 drinks per day for most adults.\nMaintain a moderate weight. A healthy weight puts less strain on your heart. To maintain a moderate weight, aim for a balance between calorie intake and expenditure through diet and exercise.\nGet enough sleep. Lack of sleep can increase your risk of heart disease and other health problems. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.\nManage stress. Chronic stress can contribute to heart disease, so it's important to find ways to manage it. Some ways to reduce stress include practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, and engaging in activities that you enjoy.\nEat at regular intervals. Skipping meals or eating irregularly can disrupt your body's natural processes and increase your risk of heart disease. Aim to eat regular, balanced meals and snacks throughout the day.\nDrink plenty of water. Staying hydrated is important for overall health, including heart health. Aim for 8-10 cups of water per day or more if you are physically active.\nAvoid processed foods. Processed foods are often high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium, which can increase your risk of heart disease. Choose whole, unprocessed foods as often as possible.\nEat more fish. Fish is a good source of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which can reduce inflammation and improve heart health. Aim to eat fish at least twice a week.\nAdd nuts to your diet. Nuts, such as almonds and walnuts, are a good source of heart-healthy unsaturated fats and protein. They can also help lower cholesterol levels.\nEat more plant-based proteins. Plant-based proteins, such as beans, tofu, and nuts, are lower in saturated fat and cholesterol than animal-based proteins. Incorporating more plant-based proteins into your diet can improve heart health.\nLimit added sugars. Added sugars are often found in processed and packaged foods and can contribute to heart disease. Aim to limit your intake of added sugars and choose foods with natural sugars, such as fruits, instead.\nEat less red and processed meat. Red and processed meats are high in saturated fat and cholesterol, which can increase your risk of heart disease. Choose lean cuts of meat and limit your intake of processed meats, such as bacon and deli meat.\nEat more whole grains. Whole grains, such as oats and brown rice, are a good source of fiber and nutrients and can help lower cholesterol levels. Choose whole grains over refined grains, such as white bread and pasta, whenever possible.\nGet your vitamin D from the sun or supplements. Vitamin D is important for bone health and may also have a protective effect on the heart. The best source of vitamin D is sunlight, but you can also get it from certain foods or supplements.\nTake a multivitamin. A daily multivitamin can ensure that you are getting all of the nutrients you need for optimal health, including heart health.\nGet your blood pressure checked regularly. High blood pressure is a risk factor for heart disease, so it's important to have it checked regularly. If your blood pressure is high, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes or medication to lower it.\nGet your cholesterol levels checked. High cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease. If your cholesterol levels are high, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes or medication to lower them.\nGet tested for diabetes. Diabetes can increase your risk of heart disease, so it's important to know your risk. Your doctor can test for diabetes through a blood test.\nSeek medical attention if you experience heart attack symptoms. Heart attack symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea. If you experience any of these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nGet Double the Heart Health Benefits\n\nFollowing these tips can quickly and naturally improve your heart health and reduce your risk of heart disease. Plus, a heart-healthy lifestyle is linked to a lower risk of developing cancer, so you have double the reason to adopt a healthy lifestyle.\n\nAccording to researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and other centers in the United States and the Netherlands, maintaining a heart-healthy lifestyle may lower the risk of developing cancer. The study, which analyzed data from two large population-based health studies involving 20,305 participants, found that traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including older age, male sex, and current or former smoking, were all associated with increased risk of cancer. Increased levels of natriuretic peptides, which are markers of stress on the heart, also predicted higher cancer risk among study participants. However, at the start of the study, those with ideal cardiovascular health had a lower risk of future cancers. The study was published in JACC: CardioOncology.\n\nAs always, consult with a healthcare professional before making any changes to your diet or exercise routine.\n"}]}

These could be themed on benefits to doctors or benefits to pharma brands, for any specific therapy area, condition, medical topic or disease.\n\n\"General Practice clinics in India have the following problems-\n- patients do not come to the clinic for timely intervention\n- general practitioners are not able to diagnose or treat special conditions\n- general practice clinics don't offer preventive, monitoring or management services for non communicable diseases and chronic conditions\n\nWe bring early detection and specialised capabilities to primary care clinics by -\n1. Bringing education to doctors from leading experts and academies.\n2. Bringing in-clinic education, screening tools, red-flag alerts, and doctor-to-doctor specialist advice.\n3. Bringing specialised services to the clinic for prevention and management of chronic conditions.  \n\nInditech delivers professional education for doctors from India's leading experts and endorsed by medical academies. Inditech delivers the education in all the common formats-\n- certificate online education modules \n- online, offline and hybrid classroom education\n- Workshops and case study clinics\nInditech enables practical use for the academy endorsed education by extending it into general practice clinics for early detection and intervention - \n- short format education on red flags for various special conditions, suitable for in-clinic distribution and consumption\n- doctor personalised multilingual patient screening tools, which report red flags to the doctors\n- screening tools for use by the doctor to identify red flags\nInditech makes the practical education actionable by -\n- when a red flag is noticed, the general practice clinic will have doctor to doctor specialist advice available to investigate and treat locally under expert advice or make a timely referral to the specialist\n- connect specialised digital therapeutics available to the general practice clinic for prevention, monitoring and management of chronic conditions and non-communicable diseases\n\nInditech leverages its vast and deep connections with experts and medical academies to create the above solutions; and works with pharma brands to distribute them to general practice clinics and also uses pharma companies to recruit specialists for the doctor-to-doctor specialist advice system.\n\nPharma brands in India spend most of their marketing and sales budgets to enhance the quality of their relationships with doctors and specialists. They use these relationships to build brand equity, brand salience and brand loyalty in the community of doctors. But brands find it difficult to build value based relationships with doctors because their field representatives are not very talented and their value based activities for doctors is mostly limited to hosting or sponsoring professional education events for them. In addition, there is the need for differentiation from competing pharma brands.\n\nInditech's solutions represent a win-win opportunity, wherein brands can partner with Inditech for their therapy areas. They can become the distribution or promotion partners for Inditech's services for the doctors/clinics they target. They can also become the recruitment partner for specialists in a specific therapy area, for a region.  This helps them to bring high and differentiated value to the doctors. Inditech also benefits by revenue, where the pharma brand partner pays Inditech a fee for each doctor served under the partnership. \""}]}

She is noted to have a marked diuresis.\na) What would you expect the urine osmolality to be in this case and why?According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information article 1 Peer-reviewed evidence states that Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic, which means that it draws water out of cells and into the bloodstream, which in turn increases urine output.When a person is administered an intravenous drip of 5% mannitol, the mannitol molecules will pull water out of the cells and into the bloodstream, which leads to an increase in urine output, also known as diuresis.Regarding the urine osmolality, we would expect the urine osmolality to be lower than the plasma osmolality in this case, because the mannitol is drawing water out of the cells and into the bloodstream, which in turn causes an increase in urine output, and dilutes the concentration of substances in the urine such as electrolytes and dissolved substances, thus resulting in a decrease in urine osmolality.It's important to note that excessive diuresis in an individual may lead to Electrolyte imbalances which should be closely monitored during and post-surgery.Web search results:\n\n[1] \"In general, the peer review process includes the following steps: First, the author submits the manuscript to the editor.

These types of diuresis include:Osmotic diuresis: This type of diuresis is caused by the presence of a substance in the bloodstream that is not reabsorbed by the kidneys, and instead pulls water out of the renal tubules. Examples of such substances include mannitol, as discussed in the previous question, and glucose in diabetes. In osmotic diuresis, we expect the urine osmolality to be lower than the plasma osmolality, and the major osmoles present in this situation would be the substance that causes the diuresis, such as Mannitol.Secretory diuresis: This type of diuresis occurs as a result of the active secretion of a substance, such as the hormone vasopressin, into the renal tubules. As a result, urine output increases and urine osmolality is usually lower than plasma osmolality . In this case, the major osmoles would be the substance that causes the diuresis.Renal diuresis: This type of diuresis is caused by an increase in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, which leads to an increase in urine output. The urine osmolality in this case may be similar to the plasma osmolality.Neurogenic diuresis: This type of diuresis occurs as a result of an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity, which leads to an increase in renal blood flow and urine output.

The urine osmolality in this case may be similar to the plasma osmolalityRebound diuresis : Refers to a specific type of diuresis where a person may have a decrease in urine output, then returns to normal or excessive urine output. It happens after a period of low or restricted fluid intake or after use of diuretic drugs.Immersion diuresis: This type of diuresis occurs when a person is submerged in water, leading to an increase in urine output. This is due to an increase in renal blood flow and renal afferent arteriole resistance caused by immersion in water. The urine osmolality in this case may be similar to the plasma osmolality.It is important to note that not all types of diuresis are well-established by peer-review evidence, and the classification and mechanisms of diuresis may vary depending on the source.

She is having a massive diuresis, her urine output is 450 cc/hour. Her serum sodium is 164 mmol/L (normal up to 145 mmol/L). \na) Based on the clinical information, what is the likely diagnosis? \nuse peer reviewed sources onlyBased on the clinical information provided, the 17-year-old student who was not wearing a bicycle helmet when hit by a car and sustained a head injury with a massive diuresis and high serum sodium levels is likely to be diagnosed with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).According to 1, Peer-reviewed evidence shows that the majority of traumatic brain injuries are caused by accidents, such as falls, motor vehicle accidents, and bicycle accidents, and one of the most effective ways to prevent TBI is by wearing a helmet, which is reinforced by the fact that the majority of head and/or facial injuries in the study were caused by individuals not wearing a helmet.Traumatic Brain injury is a complex injury with different degrees of severities, and along with a head injury, it's important to note that it can also cause changes in the balance of fluid and electrolytes and lead to a condition called SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion) which causes an increase in the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to water retention and an increase in urine concentration, resulting in a high urine output and increased serum sodium levels.It is important to note that as explained by 2, helmet use laws varies by states, some states requires all riders under 16 years of age to wear a helmet when on a bicycle, some states have no state-wide law and some cities like Cicero, Inverness, and Skokie all require helmets for those under 16 years of age, regardless of the laws, the use of a helmet is recommended by most experts as it can help prevent or reduce the severity of brain injuries caused by accidents.Web search results:\n\n[1] \"The easy way to calculate total body water is simply to multiply 0.6 times your weight in kilograms, since roughly 2/3 of your body weight is water.

If the provided search results refer to multiple subjects with the same name, write separate answers for each subject.\nPrompt: b) What is her total body water deficit?Based on the clinical information provided, to determine the total body water (TBW) deficit, we can use one of the equation-based calculations provided by peer-reviewed sources. One commonly used method is to calculate TBW as 60% of body weight, as stated in 1Given the weight of the patient as 60 kg, the total body water can be calculated as:\nTBW = 0.6 x 60 kg = 36 litersTo determine the total body water deficit, we can use another equation which is based on the serum sodium concentration, as provided by 2The formula is: Water deficit = (0.6 x body weight x (desired serum sodium - actual serum sodium))/1000Given the desired serum sodium as 140 mmol/L, and the actual serum sodium as 164 mmol/L, we can substitute these values into the formula:\nWater deficit = (0.6 x 60 x (140-164))/1000 = -3.12 litersSo the total body water deficit is -3.12 liters which is an indication of hypernatremia, which is an electrolyte imbalance characterized by an excessive amount of sodium in the blood. In other words, there is an excess of water loss from the body and the body is trying to retain water to compensate for that. This scenario can occur in Traumatic brain injury patients who are diagnosed with SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion) which causes an increase in the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to water retention and an increase in urine concentration.\nIt's worth noting that the percentage of water in the body can vary depending on varioususe the following to compute the water deficit: Estimate the patient's total body water (TBW): TBW (L) = k x weight (kg). Calculate FWD (L) = TBW (L) x ((serum Na+ concentration/140)-1)Another method to calculate the total body water deficit is to use the following equation:Estimate the patient's total body water (TBW): TBW (L) = k x weight (kg)\nHere, k is a constant that is used to estimate total body water, typically around 0.6 for adult males and 0.5 for adult females. So for this patient it will be 0.6 x 60 kg = 36 LCalculate FWD (L) = TBW (L) x ((serum Na+ concentration/140)-1)Given the patient's serum sodium concentration of 164 mmol/L and the normal value of 140 mmol/L\nFWD = 36 L x ((164/140) -1) = -4.8 LThis method also gives a negative number, indicating that the patient's serum sodium is higher than the normal value, and therefore, the patient has a water deficit, which also is an indication of Hypernatremia, as previously stated.It's worth noting that different methods of calculating total body water and water deficit may give slightly different results and that the exact method used should depend on the specific context of the patient and the goals of treatment. In any case, it's important to measure the blood sodium level frequently in patients with such diagnosis and adjust treatment accordingly, and also monitoring the patient's fluid and electrolyte status closely and to follow the treatment protocol accordingly."}]}

However, modern computer-assisted techniques have also allowed precise recording and analysis of lung sounds, prompting the correlation of acoustic indexes with measures of lung mechanics. This innovative, though still little used, approach has improved our knowledge of acoustic mechanisms and increased the clinical usefulness of auscultation.

First, please make me a vocabulary list with definitions that I can study later. \n\nStarting with the Introduction section: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and chronic hepatitis B (HBV) virus infection is the leading risk factor1. The recurrence rate after surgical resection remains high, and the prognosis is still poor for patients with unresectable HCC and treatment options are limited1. More than 80% of HCC cases are characterized by extensive liver fibrosis caused by the activation, proliferation, and accumulation of fibroblasts2. A hallmark feature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of HCC is the mass of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which can secrete multiple cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, supporting cancer cells both directly and indirectly2,3. Although these CAF-derived factors serve as direct survival signals to cancer cells, they also alter the immune cell milieu by inhibiting the activity of immune effector cells and recruiting immune suppressor cells, allowing cancer cells to evade immune surveillance4.\n\nIn previous studies, different CAF subtypes with various functions have been extensively revealed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)5, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas6, breast cancer7 and lung tumors8. Hence, the multifaceted nature of CAFs suggests that they include diverse subpopulations, and an improved understanding of stromal heterogeneity may explain how CAFs contribute to the dynamic complexity and functional malleability of the tumor ecosystem3. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have overcome some of the technical hurdles in the investigation of cellular heterogeneity among complex tissues such as carcinomas9,10. Specifically, scRNA-seq has been applied to segregate CAFs into inflammatory (iCAF) and myofibroblastic (myCAF) subpopulations in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) that display distinct ligand-receptor interactions and promote ICC via different CAF-cancer cell interactions11,12. However, stromal heterogeneity, especially CAFs, and the interplay between malignant cells and stromal cells at single-cell resolution in HCC remain poorly understood. Although previous studies have reported that CAFs modulate HCC progression through various mechanisms regardless of the CAF subtypes within tumors4, it is unclear whether different protumoral mechanisms underlying CAF subpopulations exist in HCC, and the intricate crosstalk between CAFs and other components in the TME remains unknown, particularly for different CAF subtypes.\n\nHere, we performed scRNA-seq of human or murine HCC tumors and identified 5 common CAF subtypes in HCC tumors, namely, vCAFs, mCAFs, lpmCAFs (CD36+ CAFs), lpCAFs and apCAFs, among which the newly identified CD36+ CAF subset was highlighted. CD36 mediated oxidized LDL uptake-dependent migration inhibitory factor (MIF) expression via the lipid peroxidation/p38/CEBPs axis in CD36+ CAFs, which recruited CD33+ MDSCs in a macrophage MIF- and CD74-dependent manner. Moreover, CD36+ CAFs potentiated the capacity of MDSCs to enhance the immunosuppressive TME and cancer stemness. The number of CD36+ CAFs might predict the HCC immunotherapy response, and targeting CD36 with SSO was used to synergistically enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in different murine HCC models. Together, our results provide a comprehensive transcriptomic overview and reveal novel intercellular crosstalks between CD36+ CAFs, CD33+ MDSCs and HCC cells, suggesting a potential microenvironment-targeting combination therapy for HCC.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Growing and maintaining healthy, strong bones is crucial.\n\nIt's estimated that you reach peak bone mass around age 30. But there's good news: You can play a significant role in your bone health. This may mean that you either slow down or prevent osteoporosis (a disease characterized by brittle and breaking bones).1\n\nLearn more about how you can strengthen your bones and what can help, including the foods you'll want to add to your diet.\n\nWhat Can You Do To Help Your Bone Health?\nExercise and physical activity can keep bones healthy from childhood through adulthood. Kids and teens should aim for an hour of physical activity daily, while adults need about two hours and 30 minutes each week.1 Ideally, you would mix in exercises that are:\n\nWeight-bearing (e.g., walking, running, dancing, team sports)\nStrength training (e.g., lifting free weights, body-weight regimens)\nNon-weight-bearing (e.g., cycling, swimming)\nYou may also like yoga, pilates, or tai chi to improve flexibility, core strength, and balance. Additionally, a diet full of calcium and vitamin D can help if you develop osteoporosis. Getting plenty of calcium and vitamin D may slow the disease and prevent fractures.1\nHow Are Calcium and Vitamin D Helpful in Strengthening Your Bones?\nCalcium is a mineral that supports your bone and teeth structure and hardness. About 98% of your body's calcium can be found in your bones. The rest of your body sort of uses your bones as a calcium bank.2\n\nVitamin D is found naturally in a few foods, including fish and mushrooms, but it's mainly found in fortified foods. Your body also produces it when your skin is in the sun. Vitamin D improves calcium absorption and bone growth and helps your muscles, nerves, and immune system.3\n\nYou want to make sure that you get enough of each nutrient to maintain healthy bones. Adults should aim to get the following recommended amounts of calcium and vitamin D:24\n\nAdults up to age 50: 1,000 milligrams of calcium and 600 international units of vitamin D\nAdults ages 51 to 70: 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams of calcium and 600 international units of vitamin D\nAdults aged 71 and older: 1,200 milligrams of calcium and 800 international units of vitamin D\nYou can meet your calcium and vitamin D requirements by trying these 11 foods for healthy bones.\n\nDairy Products\nDairy products—like milk, yogurt, and cheese—can be excellent sources of calcium to help strengthen your bones.\n\nMilk\nMilk has several nutrients—18 out of the 22 that are most important for human health, including calcium. It is also considered one of the richest sources of naturally occurring calcium. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, different types of milk contain various amounts of calcium. Some examples include:56\n\n1 cup of 1% milk: 305 milligrams of calcium\n1 cup of skim milk: 298 milligrams of calcium\n1 cup of buttermilk: 284 milligrams of calcium\nYogurt\nAnother good source of naturally occurring calcium is yogurt. Dairy-based fat-free and low-fat yogurts can provide between 30% and 45% of calcium's daily value. Specifically, 8 ounces of low or nonfat plain yogurt has 448-488 milligrams of calcium, while 8 ounces of non- or low-fat plain Greek yogurt has 250-261 milligrams of calcium.57\n\nYogurt also contains other nutrients, such as:\n\nVitamin D (in fortified versions)\nMagnesium\nVitamin B12\nRiboflavin\nIodine\nCheese\nYou may be happy to know cheese can be a calcium source that provides other minerals, vitamins, and protein. Each kind of cheese packs a different punch so let's break it down. The estimated calcium contents for the following cheeses are:910\n\n1/4 cup of diced Swiss cheese: 294 milligrams\n1/4 cup of nonfat shredded mozzarella cheese: 272 milligrams\n1/4 cup of diced, low-fat American cheese: 240 milligrams\n1/4 cup of diced cheddar cheese: 234 milligrams\n1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese: 213 milligrams\n1/2 cup of ricotta cheese: 337 milligrams\n4 ounces of cottage cheese: 125 milligrams\nAs much as you may want to eat cheese for its calcium, it's a good idea to eat it in moderation. Cheese can be high in salt and saturated fats—two things that can raise blood pressure and LDL cholesterol (aka the bad cholesterol).\n"}]}

These meetings will include curated prompts to facilitate meaningful discussions, such as topics related to adversity, stress management, and overcoming obstacles. The program officially kicked off in late September, following the conclusion of the summer academies. We worked with Dr. Sudario to implement this program and hope to make a positive impact on the academic and professional journey of the participants. We worked with SNMA, LMSA, Guiding hands, and PRIME/LEAD academies to draw from the organizations for course organization collaborations. We have contacted these organizations to start a long-term fruitful relationship, and support underrepresented students in medicine to receive longitudinal support from current students with similar backgrounds.

Both she and\nher husband, Tom Shu, originally came to Canada as children when their parents emigrated. They\nmet when they were university students, attending Simon Fraser University. They are in a stable,\nlong-term relationship. Mrs. Shu and her husband did not have children and she has kept a warm\nrelationship with her cousins and their families, who live in Hong Kong. The Shu’s long term Family\nPhysician, Dr. Yee, retired last year and was not able to find a replacement Family Physician for\nhis practice. Since then, the Shu’s have been attending walk-in clinics for their medical care. She\nhas no known drug allergies.\nTom Shu became extremely concerned about his wife’s symptoms of fever and chills over the past\ntwo days, so he brought her into the Emergency for assessment. You are the medical student on\ncall for the clinical teaching unit this evening. The emergency physician has asked your service to\nsee Mrs. Shu for admission. She tells you she gets recurrent bladder infections, and just started\nan antibiotic two days ago prescribed by a local walk-in clinic. Upon further questioning, Mrs. Shu\nexplains that she developed burning with urination 4 days ago. This was associated with a strong\nneed to urinate every couple of hours, though for only small amounts each time. She has no\nabnormal vaginal discharge or pruritis. Before going to the walk-in clinic, she didn’t feel feverish,\nthough she did have some back discomfort. She brought her pills in with her, and you note she\nwas prescribed nitrofurantoin. She has not had sex with her husband in several weeks. She\nrecently returned from her annual one-month trip to Hong Kong where she required oral\nantibiotics for a UTI. You don’t recognize the drug name, but look it up and see that it’s a thirdgeneration oral cephalosporin.\nSince starting the nitrofurantoin her symptoms have progressively worsened. She now has severe\npain in her right lower back. She’s also developed chills and shakes, sometimes uncontrollably.\nShe is nauseated with several episodes of vomiting, and has had little to eat or drink over the past\nday. On physical examination, she is alert and oriented but looks uncomfortable. Vitals signs show a\nheart rate of 110, blood pressure of 100/62, respiratory rate of 26, O2 saturation of 96% on room\nair, and a temperature of 38.9°C. She is 5’6” with a weight of 120 pounds. Her head and neck\nexamination is unremarkable. She has no neurological deficits and her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)\nis 15. Cardiac auscultation reveals tachycardia with a regular rhythm and no extra heart sounds\nor murmurs. JVP is not seen. Respiratory auscultation is normal. Abdominal exam reveals a right\nupper quadrant scar consistent with previous open cholecystectomy. There is no percussion\ntenderness of the abdomen. The abdomen is soft but she is tender above the pubic symphysis.\nDeep palpation reveals discomfort in the right mid abdomen. She is exquisitely tender when you\npalpate her right lower back, the left side is unremarkable. Genital examination reveals no rashes,\nsores, or ulcers. She has atrophic appearing labia externa and dry vaginal mucosa. She has no\npalpable lymph nodes. The urethra appears normal and there is no pelvic organ prolapse."}]}

The optic cups are precursors to the retina, and its development within the mini organoids resembled the emergence of eye structures in human embryos.\n\nThe research could help scientists understand eye diseases, eye development, and differentiation processes, reports Michelle Starr for Science Alert. The study was published this week in the journal Cell Stem Cell.\n\nOrganoids are small, three-dimensional tissue cultures that can replicate organs. Researchers grow tiny organoids from stem cells, or cells that have the potential to mature into any cell in the body, reports Yasemin Saplakoglu for Live Science. Growing organoids allows researchers to peer into how organs develop and provide valuable insights into how organs could react to specific drugs or treatments.\n\nThere are two types of stem cells: adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a type of adult stem cell, which are derived from human embryos. Instead, iPSCs are taken from adult human cells, usually from a skin or blood sample, and converted into an embryonic-like state. Instead of remaining a skin or blood cell, these iPSC cells can now develop into any cell in the body.\n\nIn previous studies, only pure retinal cells or optic cups were grown in the lab individually. Jay Gopalakrishnan, an organoid expert at University Hospital Düsseldorf, and his colleagues used iPSC-grown mini brains to see if eye structures could develop as an integrated part of the organoid—instead of growing the two parts separately, Science Alert reports."}]}

for us to start today okay so i'm a medical doctor um this is my third career in medicine uh i started as a pediatrician i was an infectious disease specialist\n00:49\ni was an emergency doctor and now i have a very large natural medicine clinic in clearwater florida i've been doing this for 23 years started with my wife originally she's a nurse and we really specialize in people with unsolved medical problems so our average patient has seen 13 doctors lyme cancer central nervous system disease autoimmune disease things like that about 20 years ago i started a nutrition company which is called body health and we make really very high quality nutritional products uh my hobbies are iron man i've done 43\n01:31\nof them uh you're in coeur d'alene so i've done coeur d'alene i think twice maybe three times that iron man um so i'm active i love what i do and um i'm excited to be here and talk to you i'm excited to have you now fill my listeners in a little bit on this iron man stuff and you said you've had three medical careers how old are you dr minkoff 782 and you're still an active um engaged athlete at this age yeah i i mean the first i scheduled uh four races for the spring of course they\n02:09\nwere all cancelled i'm supposed to do a half iron man the end of september uh it's still on and then i'm doing an ironman in november and so far it's still up so we'll just what happens i'm training is it's gonna it was as if it's gonna happen i love that talk about inspirational when people say they are too old to do something uh they just need to come and look at your stuff yeah i mean age is a is is if you know i see people every day who say well i'm 60 now and i should retire and\n02:42\ni'm old and i can't do it and really i think at 60 you should be smarter than you were when you were 40 you know more you're probably financially better off than you were you could make a bigger impact uh you can help more people and so i just don't see that anything other than what i'm doing would be very much fun and and so i just i love this my my uh office manager's been with me for eight 18 years and a couple years ago she's probably just 50.\n03:11\nso a couple of years ago she said to me like i'm not retiring till i'm at least 65 and that means you're not retiring either so um that's good with that's good for me and you're helping so many people so that's got to be another i mean you can't go anywhere yet because i think you have unfinished business now right definitely do definitely do so i so appreciate that so what got you moving kind of out of a more traditional medical career into more of what you do now where you're a little\n03:45\ntaking a little bit more of a holistic i guess approach to things yeah well i was i was working in the emergency room it was a chest pain centers and it's one of the top 100 hospitals in the united states and we would see you know people with heart attacks and strokes and broken legs and gunshot wounds is pretty much all-purpose uh community hospital emergency room and my wife is a nurse and she's also a triathlete and she was very interested in health like before i was i wasn't interested in health\n04:16\nfrom a performance standpoint for myself but in terms of uh sort of as a career or anything like that i it was i wasn't interested or i didn't know about it so one of the first things that she did was she started reading about mercury and mercury is put into the silver fillings in people's teeth so when they make an amount it's called an amalgam because an amalgam is a group of metals that are all bonded together so a standard amalgam filling which is it's about 50 mercury which is liquid you know\n04:47\nprobably all everybody's probably played with mercury we've seen mercury in a thermometer so it's it's 50 mercury and then if you add copper tin silver you get an amalgam and they put that in teeth mercury at room temperature is liquid it boils at about 110 degrees so if you heat it up if you have a hot cup of coffee or soup or tea which might be 140 or 150 degrees when it hits that mercury some of that mercury is going to boil it's going to come off you're going to swallow it you're going\n05:19\nto inhale it and it's going to come into your body there's lots of experiments with sheep where they put fillings in and and then they would put a label on the on the mercury so they could track where it went in the body and then they'd just have the sheep do its normal life in a couple months they would then sacrifice the sheep and look to see where did the mercury go and they would find it in the brain in the kidney and the adrenal glands of the lung and the heart it goes places so anyway she learned about this and she\n05:46\ndecided that she should get the mercury taken out of her teeth now there is a safe way to do this but this is back in like 1995 1996 there were very few dentists who knew about it and the dentist that she went to didn't know about it and he took his high speed drill and he drilled out 14 mercury fillings and within about six or eight weeks she started to become ill her thyroid started to hurt and then her liver started to hurt and then so i i was in the emergency room i knew all the good doctors i had them uh see her\n06:22\nand what they decided was that she had some kind of an autoimmune condition where her immune system was actually attacking her and it was attacking her thyroid it's a common condition called hashimoto's thyroiditis and her liver enzymes were inflamed and they tested her for viruses and ultrasounds and all this stuff and they didn't they didn't find anything so um then after that one morning she wakes up and she has weakness of her arm she's having trouble brushing her teeth and she has weakness of her glute muscle\n06:50\non the same side and so she saw a neurologist and they thought well maybe this condition is ms or something like that and they wanted to put her on very strong toxic medicines like prednisone it's a steroid and interferon and at that point we were both like we got to find a better answer to this so we started looking around and then she's a nurse and she has a business which uh sends people uh home health care so they send people in people's houses to dressing changes and baths and helping them take\n07:25\nthe medicine and her office was then the office next was vacant and so a dentist moved in there and on the marquee it said natural dentistry and one day i was driving to pick her up he was walking out of his office and he and i stopped him and introduced myself and i said what's natural dentistry and he said well most dentists have the idea or the belief or an education that your mouth isn't really part of your body that it's a separate thing and that you could do things in the mouth that you would never do in the rest of\n07:59\nthe body like you'd never put mercury in someone's arm they don't even put mercury on a wound now the old medicine mercurical is pretty much banned there used to be mercury in in contact lens solution but it's toxic and so a regular doctor would never utilize that kind of material so he said that's how we think so we're trying to do things in the mouth that are complementary to the body not harmful to the body so i said oh that makes sense so i said listen to the story and i told him a story about my wife\n08:31\nand without a hesitation he said she's mercury toxic but there's nobody in this town that's going to help you there is a doctor in seattle he does training courses for doctors you should go there you should learn about this and then come back and see if what i'm saying is true so i did that i went to seattle i spent a bunch of time with him i learned his methodology and i came back and i tested her and she was mercury toxic and so he had a protocol to detoxify people i did that protocol and within four or\n09:02\nfive months she was fine her liver was fine her thyroid's fine all of her weakness went away so we had friends who were sort of watching this whole thing go on and they came up to me and said well i have rheumatoid arthritis or i've got chronic migraine headaches or i've got ulcerative colitis can you help me and at the time i wasn't very confident about what i knew like i had a case success of one and so i'm in the emergency room it's shift work you know it's like seven in the morning or seven at night or seven at\n09:33\nnight seven in the morning three or four days a week and i had some off days and i just and in her nursing office she had an extra room so i said okay i'm gonna set up shop there you guys come in i wasn't charging anybody at the beginning because i wasn't sure i knew what i was doing and we'll just experiment and the thing it just blew up just like blew up and within about nine months we had it we rented another space in that same building 3 000 square feet we set it up within a year and a half we moved into\n10:02\nanother building that was 10 000 square feet so the thing just mushroomed and as as i got better at it i left the emergency room and i she and i went all over the country learning from various doctors who had kind of non-traditional approaches to helping people who had injuries or illnesses that regular doctors weren't being very successful and so that's kind of what we've ended up with now that's awesome i love it and it in and that kind of morphed into your your supplement business as well now um yeah because yeah because originally\n10:43\nin 2000 there weren't very many products to detoxify mercury safely when we first started we were doing an iv solution it's a medicine called dmsa or dmps but this stuff is toxic and patients would get an iv of this stuff and at the end of the treatment they'd be holding their back because their kidneys were affected by the toxicity of the medicine so i found a nutritional biochemist and and we worked together to develop a product that would safely remove heavy metals from the body it's called metal\n11:16\nfree and we've been selling it for 20 years and i used it first in the practice and then other doctors heard about it and we saw we started this company called body health and now we sell it to doctors all over the world it's really a good product it's very safe and it can detoxify the heavy metals from someone uh without them getting sick that's awesome so i read your book and i really appreciate appreciated what you had to say about amino acids okay and if my listeners don't know the the name of your book is the search for\n11:51\nthe perfect protein it's available on amazon and all sorts of other places and i really loved how you broke down amino acid profiles in this book because protein is protein is protein is not really the case and a lot of people think like we have lots of people of different nutritional beliefs such as being vegan or keto or who knows what they all think that a gram of protein is just a gram of protein and your book kind of breaks that down so today i'm hoping that we can expand on that a little bit absolutely um this is not taught in\n12:33\nin dietary science it is not taught in nutritional science and i never learned it before i sort of ran into it by accident"}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi bot, do you know what kinesiotaping is?\nYes, I'm familiar with kinesiotaping. It's a type of physical therapy that uses elastic tape to support and stabilize muscles and joints. The tape is applied in specific patterns to help with muscle alignment and balance, and to promote blood flow and healing. It's often used to treat injuries and chronic conditions, such as back pain, knee pain, and tendonitis.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nokay, so listen. My friend is a stomatologist and he does research on kinesiotaping in stomatology. What he does is he takes out wisdom teeth of his patients and wants to see if kinesiotaping can make the process of healing faster or less painful. He has 2 groups of patients - those that were kinesiotaped and a control group. As I am a statistician he has asked me with help of analyzing his data to show if his results are significant, coul you help me with choosing a method to do that? \nSure, I'd be happy to help with that. To analyze your friend's data and determine whether kinesiotaping has a significant effect on the healing process after wisdom tooth removal, you can use a statistical test called a hypothesis test. This test will allow you to compare the two groups of patients (the kinesiotaped group and the control group) and determine whether any differences between the groups are likely due to the kinesiotaping, or if they could have occurred by chance.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nany hypothesis test in particular?\nOne common hypothesis test that could be used in this situation is the t-test. This test is used to compare the means (averages) of two groups, and determine whether any differences between the groups are statistically significant. The t-test assumes that the data is normally distributed, so you would need to check for normality in your data before using this test.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nhow do I check if the data is normally distributed?\nTo check whether your data is normally distributed, you can use a statistical test called the Shapiro-Wilk test. This test will determine whether the data is likely to have come from a population with a normal distribution. To perform the test, you would need to calculate the Shapiro-Wilk statistic for your data, and compare it to a critical value from a table of critical values. If the calculated statistic is greater than the critical value, then the data is considered to be normally distributed.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nok and what if the data is not normally distributed?\nIf your data is not normally distributed, then you would need to use a different statistical test to analyze the data. One option in this situation would be to use a nonparametric test, such as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or the Mann-Whitney U test. These tests are designed for data that is not normally distributed, and can be used to compare the means of two groups. Like the t-test, these tests will allow you to determine whether any differences between the groups are statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nthen why not use these tests also for normally distributed data?\nWhile nonparametric tests can be used with normally distributed data, they are generally less powerful than parametric tests like the t-test. This means that they may be less likely to detect significant differences between the groups, even if those differences exist. So, if your data is normally distributed, it's usually better to use a parametric test like the t-test, because it will provide more accurate and precise results. However, if your data is not normally distributed, then a nonparametric test is the better choice.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nalso my friend has asked me how many patients should be in his data before I can have meaningful tests\nThe number of patients in your data will affect the power of your statistical tests, which is the probability of detecting a real difference between the groups if one exists. In general, the more patients you have in your data, the more powerful your tests will be. This means that you will be more likely to detect a significant difference between the groups if one exists.\n\nHowever, there is no set number of patients that you need in order to have meaningful results. The appropriate sample size will depend on the size of the effect you are trying to detect, the level of precision you need, and the type of test you are using. In some cases, a small sample size may be sufficient, while in other cases, a larger sample size may be needed. It's best to consult with a statistician or other expert to determine the appropriate sample size for your study.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nany rule of thumb on this one? especially if i'm using the t-test\nThere is no set rule for determining the sample size for a t-test, as it will depend on the specific circumstances of your study. However, as a general rule of thumb, you will need at least 30 samples per group in order to have adequate power to detect a significant difference between the groups. This is because the t-test is a parametric test that assumes a normal distribution of the data, and a sample size of 30 is generally considered the minimum required to adequately approximate a normal distribution.\n\nHowever, this is just a general guideline, and the appropriate sample size for your study may be different. It's best to consult with a statistician or other expert to determine the appropriate sample size for your specific study.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nalright comming back to my friend and his research he has also asked me what measurements should he take during the research, could you help with that also?\nTo determine the effectiveness of kinesiotaping on the healing process after wisdom tooth removal, your friend will need to measure certain outcomes or variables. These could include the amount of pain experienced by the patients, the time it takes for the patients to heal, and any complications that occur during the healing process. Your friend will also need to measure the same variables for both the kinesiotaped group and the control group, in order to compare the two groups and determine whether the kinesiotaping had any effect.\n\nIt's important to choose the right variables to measure, because these will determine the results of the study. Your friend will need to consider which outcomes are most important to evaluate, and how to measure them accurately and reliably. He may also need to consider any potential confounding factors that could affect the results, and how to control for these in the study design. A statistician or other expert can help your friend choose the right variables and design the study in the most effective way.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\none thing he has chosen to measure is jaw circumference, do you think it is a smart thing to measure?\nMeasuring jaw circumference could potentially be a useful way to evaluate the effectiveness of kinesiotaping on the healing process after wisdom tooth removal. The jaw circumference is related to swelling in the area, and swelling can be a common issue after wisdom tooth removal. By measuring the jaw circumference, your friend could potentially determine whether kinesiotaping helps to reduce swelling and improve the healing process.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider whether this is the most important outcome to measure, and whether it can be measured accurately and reliably. Measuring jaw circumference could be difficult, and it's possible that other outcomes, such as pain levels or the time it takes for the patients to heal, may be more important to evaluate. It's best to consult with a statistician or other expert to determine the most appropriate variables to measure in your friend's study.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nhow do you define \"time it takes for the patients to heal\" especially how does he know when the patient has healed already?\nIn this context, \"time it takes for the patients to heal\" refers to the amount of time that elapses between the wisdom tooth removal surgery and the point at which the patient has fully recovered from the surgery. This could be measured in a number of ways, such as by tracking the length of time until the patient no longer experiences any pain or discomfort, or until the incision site has fully healed.\n\nDetermining when a patient has fully healed can be somewhat subjective, and it may depend on the specific criteria that your friend establishes for the study. For example, he could define \"fully healed\" as the point at which the patient no longer experiences any pain or discomfort, or when the incision site is no longer visible. He could also use objective measures, such as the results of a physical examination, to determine whether the patient has fully healed. It's important to choose clear and specific criteria for determining when a patient has fully healed, in order to ensure that the results of the study are accurate and reliable.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nand how would you collect the data on \"pain levels\"?\nTo collect data on pain levels, your friend could use a variety of methods, depending on the specific goals of his study. One common method is to use a pain intensity scale, such as a numerical rating scale or a visual analogue scale. These scales allow patients to rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10, or to indicate their pain level by marking a line on a scale. This allows for a more precise measurement of pain intensity than simply asking patients whether they are experiencing pain.\n\nYour friend could also use other methods to collect data on pain levels, such as by asking patients to keep a daily diary or log of their pain levels, or by conducting regular interviews or surveys to assess pain intensity. The choice of method will depend on the specific goals of the study, as well as the availability of resources and the preferences of the patients. A statistician or other expert can help your friend choose the most appropriate methods for collecting data on pain levels.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nAs of now he has chosen to count how many painkillers each patient has taken each day, do you think it is a good idea?\nCounting the number of painkillers taken by each patient could potentially be a useful way to assess pain levels after wisdom tooth removal. The number of painkillers taken can be an objective measure of pain intensity, and it can provide a quantitative measure of the effectiveness of kinesiotaping on pain management. However, this method has some limitations, and it may not provide a complete picture of the patient's pain levels.\n\nOne potential limitation of this method is that not all patients will experience the same level of pain, and some patients may be more or less sensitive to pain than others. This means that the number of painkillers taken by a patient may not accurately reflect their actual pain levels. Additionally, some patients may choose not to take painkillers, or may not be able to take them due to other medical conditions. This could make it difficult to compare the pain levels of different patients based on the number of painkillers taken.\n\nOverall, counting the number of painkillers taken by each patient could be a useful method for assessing pain levels, but it should not be the only method used. It's important to use a combination of methods to assess pain levels, in order to provide a more complete and accurate picture of the patient's pain experience. A statistician or other expert can help your friend choose the most appropriate methods for collecting data on pain levels.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nokay, I think I know everything from my side. Thanks very much\nYou're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. I'm here to help.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nhmm... one thing still bugs me - his research will be published as a paper and he doesn't have an abstract yet\nAn abstract is a brief summary of a research paper that provides an overview of the paper's main points and findings. An abstract should be concise and to the point, and should include the main objectives of the study, the methods used, the results obtained, and the conclusions reached.\n\nTo write an abstract for your friend's research on kinesiotaping and wisdom tooth removal, you can start by summarizing the main objectives of the study. This could include the specific question that the study is trying to answer, such as whether kinesiotaping can help to reduce pain and improve the healing process after wisdom tooth removal. Next, you can briefly describe the methods used in the study, such as the number of patients and the variables measured. You can then summarize the results of the study, such as whether kinesiotaping had a significant effect on the outcomes measured. Finally, you can state the main conclusions of the study, such as whether kinesiotaping is an effective treatment for improving the healing process after wisdom tooth removal.\n\nAn abstract should be no more than a few hundred words, so it's important to be concise and to focus on the most important points of the study. A well-written abstract will provide readers with a clear and concise overview of the study, and will help them to decide whether they want to read the full paper.\n\n\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\ncould you help me with writing abstract for his paper?\nSure, I'd be happy to help with that. Here's an example of an abstract for your friend's research on kinesiotaping and wisdom tooth removal:\n\nThe use of kinesiotaping has been shown to have beneficial effects on muscle alignment and healing, but its effects on the healing process after wisdom tooth removal have not been well studied. In this study, we compared the outcomes of wisdom tooth removal surgery in two groups of patients: one group that received kinesiotaping, and a control group that did not. We measured variables such as pain levels, healing time, and complications, and used statistical tests to determine whether any differences between the groups were statistically significant. Our results showed that kinesiotaping significantly reduced pain levels and improved the healing process after wisdom tooth removal. These findings suggest that kinesiotaping may be an effective treatment for improving the healing process after wisdom tooth removal.\n\nThis abstract provides a brief summary of the main points of the study, including the objectives, methods, results, and conclusions. It also includes key information about the study design and the variables measured, and highlights the main findings of the study. This abstract should give readers a clear understanding of the study, and should help them to decide whether they want to read the full paper.\n\nOf course, this is just an example, and your friend may want to tailor the abstract to fit the specific details of his study. He may also want to consult with a statistician or other expert to ensure that the abstract accurately reflects the findings of the study."}]}

ABSTRACT\nTuberculosis (TB) imposes a major burden on global public health which is exacerbated by the escalating number of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB cases. There is consequently an urgent need for new anti-TB drugs and combination regimens. We have investigated the natural product antibiotic fusidic acid (FA) for repurposing against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. Here, we report the results of synergy screens combining FA with a panel of approved anti-TB agents. Checkerboard and time-kill kinetics assays identified seven compounds from different chemical classes that synergized with FA in inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro: rifampicin (RIF), a rifamycin and frontline anti-TB drug; the macrolides, erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLR), and roxythromycin (ROX); the oxazolidinone, linezolid (LZD); the aminoglycoside, streptomycin (STR); and the aminocyclitol, spectinomycin (SPC). Among these, the strongest synergies were observed where FA was combined with SPC and ERY. Moreover, the FA-RIF combination was cidal, while all other FA combinations were bacteriostatic. These results provide in vitro evidence of the potential utility of FA-containing combinations against M. tuberculosis.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCombination therapy is essential to the clinical management of tuberculosis (TB) disease (1). Until recently, strategies to identify and advance promising combinations during early-stage pre-clinical TB drug discovery were limited. However, growing recognition of the need to identify new anti-TB drugs and regimens has re-focused attention on early-stage pre-clinical identification of synergizing combination partners for potential development (2), including drugs which are not clinically effective against TB (3, 4).\n\nAs part of a drug repurposing strategy, we utilized fusidic acid (FA) as anchor compound in developing matrix screening assays aimed at identifying optimal drug combination(s) that might be evaluated within the existing TB drug pipeline for potential clinical efficacy. FA, a translational inhibitor with demonstrated (albeit moderate) activity in vitro (5, 6), was selected owing to its unique mechanism of action: specifically, inhibition of mycobacterial protein synthesis by binding to elongation factor G (EF-G) (7). The antimicrobial-potentiating effect of FA with other antibiotics including the frontline anti-TB drug, ethambutol (EMB), as well as its lack of cross-resistance to other antimicrobial classes, provided additional motivation for our choice of FA (8, 9). In this short report, we present the analysis of in vitro interactions between FA and partner compounds comprising drugs currently used in TB treatment and selected translational inhibitors, the latter selected to enable evaluation the effects of combining FA with drugs acting on the same pathway (Fig. 1), (10, 11).\n\nFigure 1.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 1.\nAntibiotic targets in protein synthesis:\nSchematic representation indicating known and predicted target sites of antibiotics disrupting different stages in the (myco)bacterial translation pathway. The tRNA binding sites - amino acid (A), peptide (P), and exit (E) - on the ribosome are indicated. Adopted and modified from Wilson et al. (10).\n\nRESULTS\nCheckerboard assay identifies synergistic drug combination partners for fusidic acid\nTo identify potential partners of FA, our preliminary screens utilized Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, a fast-growing, non-pathogenic mycobacterium which has been exploited as a useful surrogate in drug efficacy studies in vitro. In standard two-drug checkerboard experiments (Table S1), SPC, ERY, CLR and TET exhibited synergy with FA, defined as FICI ≤ 0.5. These combinations displayed a 4-to 16-fold reduction in MIC90 for each of the individual drugs (Fig. S1). No antagonistic effects were observed with any of the combinations tested.\n\nThe synergies detected in M. smegmatis informed subsequent selection of combination partners for evaluation in M. tuberculosis using the checkerboard method. In addition, representative drugs consisting of clinically used anti-TB agents (first- and second-line) and selected translational inhibitors were tested in combination with FA. For these assays, a M. tuberculosis H37Rv reporter strain expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used, as described previously (12). Fig. S2 provides an example of an interaction study in which FA and ERY were analysed in the checkerboard assay. Results in Table 1 show similarity to those obtained for M. smegmatis, such that SPC, ERY and CLR exhibited synergy with FA against M. tuberculosis. The combination of FA and ERY returned a FICI value of 0.25, indicating a synergistic interaction (Fig. S2A). Other drugs that synergized with FA included RIF, STR, roxithromycin (ROX), and LZD. These synergistic interactions generally resulted in 4-to 8-fold reductions in the MICs of each drug within the combination. Even though the combination of FA and BDQ did not result in a FICI value of ≤ 0.5, it is important to note that the two displayed approximately a 4-fold reduction in their respective MICs, and the observed FICI (0.55) was very close to that defined as “synergy”. No antagonistic interaction was observed between FA and any of the compounds tested. For the combinations exhibiting synergy with FA, isobolograms were constructed by plotting the FIC curves of the FA-drug combinations (Fig. S3). Interactions between FA and ERY, SPC, and RIF were well within the synergy region (FICI < 0.5) whereas FA with STR, LZD, and ROX indicated borderline synergy (FICI = 0.5). The FA-INH interaction was included as a “no interaction” control.\n\nView inlineView popup\nTable 1.\nIn vitro synergistic interaction between FA and anti TB agents or selected translational inhibitors against M. tuberculosis::gfp\n\nTo confirm results obtained using the checkerboard assay, the strongly synergistic FA-ERY combination was evaluated in a growth inhibition assay (Fig. S4). For this purpose, FA and ERY were used at 0.3 and 27 µM, respectively, since these were the concentrations at which the lowest FICI value was obtained in the checkerboard assay (Fig. S2). RIF, at a concentration of 0.015 µM, was included as a control. In the absence of drug, the population of M. tuberculosis increased over 14 days post-inoculation. In contrast, the population of viable cells remained relatively constant over the same duration when the growth medium contained the FA and ERY combination. Similarly, the medium containing FA, ERY plus sub-MIC RIF did not display any increase in the number of viable bacterial population over a 14-day period. In contrast, cultures incubated in the presence of the individual antibiotics, FA or ERY, showed equivalent growth to the untreated control.\n\nAssessing synergistic and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of FA synergizing drugs for optimal therapy\nAs a key consideration for the clinical potential of FA combinations, the respective concentrations at which synergy was observed were compared with the reported peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) for each drug. This is important in understanding whether the concentrations required to achieve the desired response are therapeutically feasible – and, consequently, whether the results obtained from an in vitro assay have any utility in guiding therapeutic use. Except for the FA-ERY interaction, synergies between FA and its partners were achieved at concentrations predicted to be below the maximum plasma concentrations (13, 14), suggesting that these concentrations are therapeutically achievable (Fig. S5). For example, the presence of FA decreased the MIC of SPC from 201 µM to 3.14 µM, which represents a greater than 98% reduction in the MIC (Table S2). This reduced concentration is far below the Cmax value of SPC in humans (30.8 µM), determined following a 1000 mg intramuscular dose (15).\n\nAssessing cidal versus static synergies\nTo determine whether FA interactions resulted in killing or merely inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis, the method of Zhang et al. was utilized (16). INH, a bactericidal agent, was used as a reference drug, and all drugs were tested alone and in combination against the M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp bioreporter strain. Results for the bacteriostatic or cidal effects of the drug combinations with FA are illustrated (Figure 2). The FA-RIF combination displayed a MBC/MIC ratio of ≤ 2 on day 14 of evaluation, suggesting cidality. The other combinations tested – combining FA with SPC, ERY, CLR, ROX or LZD – all exhibited MBC/MIC ratios >2, implying static effects. The bacteriostatic/cidal action of individual drugs is shown in Fig. S6.\n\nFigure 2.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 2.\nBactericidal versus static effects of drug combinations against M. tuberculosis.\nAnalysis of FA in combination with synergizing drugs; ERY, SPC, CLR, ROX, RIF, and LZD. INH was used as reference drug. MBC/MIC ratio ≤2: cidal; MBC/MIC ratio > 2: static. *Sub-inhibitory concentrations of FA that exhibited the respective synergies in these checkerboard experiments are between (0.3 – 1.2 µM) Data are from a representative experiment performed in triplicate. Error bars indicate standard deviations, calculated from the mean of triplicate samples.\n\nFA synergizing partners are active against the FA-resistant mutant\nA cross-resistance study was performed using a FA-resistant M. tuberculosis mutant carrying H462Y mutation in fusA1(11). The FA-resistant mutant exhibited >100-fold MIC compared to the FA-susceptible parental strain. Six synergistic FA partner drugs – RIF, SPC, CLR, ERY, STR and ROX – were evaluated using the resazurin reduction microplate assay (REMA). The results (Fig. S7) indicated that the MIC90 values of these drugs remained the same against the FA-resistant mutant relative to the wild-type strain, confirming that there was no cross-resistance to each of the tested compounds.\n\nInteraction of FA synergizing partners with selected chemically unrelated compounds\nUsing a set of six chemically and structurally diverse drug agents (Table S3), a combination assay was performed with four drugs that had displayed synergistic interaction with FA: RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC. The aim was to determine whether these compounds displayed synergy only with FA or exhibited a wider spectrum of synergistic interactions. The results of these pairwise combinations (Figure 3) revealed potentiating interactions between all FA synergizing partners (except RIF) and THS, BDQ and CPZ. CLR displayed strong synergies with BDQ and CPZ (FICI = 0.23 in both cases). The interaction between SPC and INH was also synergistic, while the remaining compounds (EMB and MOX) exhibited no interactions in combination with RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC.\n\nFigure 3.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 3.\nDrug interaction study.\nPairwise interactions between selected drugs (blue fonts) and synergizing agents (black fonts) of FA (using M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp. Red panels indicate synergistic interactions (FICI ≤ 0.5), while green panels are no interaction (0.5 < FICI ≤ 4). The bars indicate the fold-reduction in MIC required to achieve the same effect in combination versus single-drug assays. For example, in the interaction between RIF and MOX, top right-hand panel, the FIC for RIF = 0.45 (black bar) and MOX = 0.9 (blue bar). The resulting FICI for RIF-MOX = 1.35 (green bar) which indicates an additive interaction. Data are from the representative experiment performed in duplicate.\n\n"}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please summarize the following article into 10 bullet points:\n\nNon-nutritive sweeteners – also known as sugar substitutes or artificial sweeteners – are supposed to deliver all the sweetness of sugar without the calories. But a controlled trial conducted by Weizmann Institute of Science researchers, published today in Cell, suggests that contrary to previous belief, such sweeteners are not inert. \n\n\nThey do have an effect on the human body. In fact, some can alter human consumers’ microbiomes – the trillions of microbes that live in our gut – in a way that can change a person’s blood sugar levels. And the effects these sweeteners produce vary greatly among different people.\n\nIn 2014, a Weizmann Institute study in mice had shown that some non-nutritive sweeteners might actually be contributing to changes in sugar metabolism that they are meant to prevent. In the new trial, a team of researchers headed by Prof. Eran Elinav of Weizmann’s Systems Immunology Department screened nearly 1,400 potential participants, selecting 120 who were found to strictly avoid any artificially sweetened foods or drinks. \n\n\nThe volunteers were then divided into six groups. Participants in four of the groups were handed sachets of common non-nutritive sweeteners, containing amounts that were lower than the acceptable daily intake, one sweetener per group: saccharin, sucralose, aspartame or stevia. The two other groups served as controls.\n\nThe research was led by Dr. Jotham Suez, a former graduate student of Elinav’s and now principal investigator at the John Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Yotam Cohen, a graduate student in Elinav’s lab; it was conducted in collaboration with Prof. Eran Segal of Weizmann’s Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Molecular Cell Biology Departments.\n\n\nThe researchers found that two weeks of consuming all four sweeteners altered the composition and function of the microbiome and of the small molecules the gut microbes secrete into people’s blood – each sweetener in its own way. They also found that two of the sweeteners, saccharin and sucralose, significantly altered glucose tolerance – that is, proper glucose metabolism – in the recipients. Such alterations, in turn, may contribute to metabolic disease. In contrast, no changes in either the microbiome or glucose tolerance were found in the two control groups.\n\nThe changes induced by the sweeteners in the gut microbes were closely correlated with the alterations in glucose tolerance. “These findings reinforce the view of the microbiome as a hub that integrates the signals coming from the human body’s own systems and from external factors such as the food we eat, the medications we take, our lifestyle and physical surroundings,” Elinav says.\n\nTo check whether changes in the microbiome were indeed responsible for impaired glucose tolerance, the researchers transplanted gut microbes from more than 40 trial participants into groups of germ-free mice that had never consumed non-nutritive sweeteners. \n\nIn each trial group, the transplants had been collected from several “top responders” (trial participants featuring the biggest changes in glucose tolerance) and several “bottom responders” (those featuring the least changes in glucose tolerance). \n\n\n\nChanges in the composition and function of gut microbes were observed in all four groups of trial participants who consumed non-nutritive sweeteners. Each group consumed one of the following: saccharine, sucralose, stevia or aspartame. The diagram shows increases in glucose levels in the saccharin and sucralose groups (two graphs on the left), compared to the stevia and aspartame groups (middle) and to the two control groups (right).  (CREDIT: Weizmann Institute of Science)\n\n\nStrikingly, recipient mice showed patterns of glucose tolerance that largely reflected those of the human donors. Mice that received microbiomes from the “top responders” had the most pronounced alterations in glucose tolerance, compared to mouse recipients of microbiomes from “bottom responders” and from human controls. \n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn follow-up experiments, the researchers determined how the different sweeteners affected the abundance of specific species of gut bacteria, their function and the small molecules they secrete into the bloodstream.\n\n\n“Our trial has shown that non-nutritive sweeteners may impair glucose responses by altering our microbiome, and they do so in a highly personalized manner, that is, by affecting each person in a unique way,” Elinav says. “In fact, this variability was to be expected, because of the unique composition of each person’s microbiome.”\n\n\n\n\nAdds Elinav: “The health implications of the changes that non-nutritive sweeteners may elicit in humans remain to be determined, and they merit new, long-term studies. In the meantime, it’s important to stress that our findings do not imply in any way that sugar consumption, shown to be deleterious to human health in many studies, is superior to non-nutritive sweeteners.”\n\n\n \n\n \n\nStudy participants included Dr. Rafael Valdés-Mas, Uria Mor, Dr. Mally Dori-Bachash, Dr. Sara Federici, Dr. Niv Zmora, Dr. Avner Leshem, Dr. Melina Heinemann, Raquel Linevsky, Maya Zur, Rotem Ben-Zeev Brik, Aurelie Bukimer, Shimrit Eliyahu Miller, Alona Metz, Ruthy Fischbein, Olga Sharov and Dr. Hagit Shapiro from Elinav’s lab; Drs.

Common barriers to patient-doctor communication include patients’ feeling unable to share information, cognitive impairment in patients, and the dominating nature of the biomedical culture in healthcare. The emergence of new healthcare technologies presents an opportunity to improve healthcare communication through both new tools and shifts in practices. Combined with patient-centered care models of communication, user experience design and operational implementations can be leveraged to improve the quality of the relationship between patient and medical provider, information exchange in the dyad, and shared decision-making. The present research adopts a person-centered care model of communication approach to propose design and operational implementations of eHealth technology to improve patient-doctor interactions, resulting in higher quality healthcare and a reduction in negative health outcomes. Specifically, we propose ways in which eHealth can be used for rapport building, improved information exchange, and higher quality shared decision-making between patients and doctors.\n"}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Take in consideration the following text and wait for my instructions:\n\"Discussion\nThis pilot-study is the first study to investigate in a systematic way the effects of QEEG-informed neurofeedback in ADHD. It was found that neurofeedback resulted in significant improvements on ATT, HI and comorbid depressive complaints and the response rate was 76 %. The ES obtained in this study were identical to the ES reported by Monastra et al. (2002) for ATT and were almost double the ES reported in the meta-analysis (Arns et al. 2009). In comparison, a recently conducted meta-analysis on the effects of stimulant medication in ADHD found an ES of 0.84 for Ritalin on ATT (Faraone and Buitelaar 2009). Therefore, these results suggest that personalizing the treatment to the individual QEEG improves clinical outcomes, most clearly for ATT. Regarding the effects on HI it is difficult to draw conclusions. Arns et al. (2009) already pointed out that the effects of neurofeedback on hyperactivity are to a large part due to non-specific treatment effects. In this study we only had a combined measure of HI making a direct comparison difficult and possibly explaining the slightly larger ES as compared to the other studies (see Fig. 3). Obviously, these results require replication in order to confirm these findings.\n\nWe did not find a clear relationship between a slow iAPF and treatment outcome on ADHD relevant measures as hypothesized. However, we did find that a slow anterior iAPF at baseline was associated with a smaller decrease of comorbid depressive complaints as measured on the BDI in agreement with the depression literature [tricyclic antidepressants: Ulrich et al. (1984), rTMS: Arns et al. (2010, in press); Conca et al. (2000)] supporting the notion that a slow anterior iAPF at baseline is related to worse treatment outcome on depressive complaints. In this study only few patients had an iAPF of 8 Hz or lower, whereas in Arns et al. (2008, 2010) this group was larger. Hence, in this sample the representation of slow iAPF’s might have been too low to find a clear relationship between a slow iAPF and treatment outcome on ADHD rating scales. Therefore, the conclusion that neurofeedback can be considered an effective treatment for those patients with a slow iAPF and who do not respond to stimulant medication is unjustified at this moment. More research with larger samples is required to further investigate this issue.\n\nPre- to Post-treatment Effects\nIn a sub-group of R who all underwent an SMR protocol we were able to demonstrate specific pre- to post-treatment improvements such as increased N200 and P300 amplitude and specific effects only related to the SMR EEG frequency band. The N200 has been related to stimulus discrimination (Näätänen and Picton 1986) and the P300 to attention and memory updating (for review see: Kenemans and Kähkönen 2011) and both have been found to be reduced in ADHD (for review see: Barry et al. 2003). Therefore, the finding of increased N200 and P300 amplitude suggests a normalization in underlying neural circuitry related to stimulus discrimination and attention/memory updating. Normalization of ERP components in ADHD as a result of neurofeedback has been reported by several other authors as well (Heinrich et al. 2004; Kropotov et al. 2005; Wangler et al. 2011), therefore this finding provides further support of the specificity of SMR neurofeedback in this sub-group of patients.\n\nRegarding post-treatment EEG changes, patients exhibited decreased SMR power post-treatment whereas the neurofeedback aimed at increasing this frequency band. The observed effects in the EEG were specific to the narrow SMR frequency band of 12–15 Hz and were not found in the neighboring alpha and beta frequency bands, which suggests the effects are specific to the frequency band trained (see Fig. 5).\n\nSimilar findings were observed in an earlier study by Pineda et al. (2008). They observed that children with autism demonstrated impaired mu-suppression when observing movement. In their double-blind neurofeedback study they rewarded mu rhythm (10–13 Hz) and found that mu-suppression was significantly improved after treatment. So by uptraining this frequency they found that children were better able to suppress that frequency. This finding hints at the notion that SMR neurofeedback serves as a procedure to teach people voluntary control over specific EEG frequencies, rather then structurally upregulate this EEG activity. This would be more in line with the Slow Cortical Potential neurofeedback (SCP) approach where children with ADHD learn to self-regulate their SCP towards both positivity and negativity (Heinrich et al. 2004; Strehl et al. 2006). In an earlier BCI study in which we compared SCP and SMR as a means of achieving voluntary control, we also demonstrated that healthy volunteers are able to self regulate SMR in a comparable way as subjects can self-regulate their SCP’s. In this study subjects had to randomly enhance or suppress their SMR relative to baseline, and 30 % gained control by SMR suppression whereas 40 % gained by control by SMR enhancement (Kleinnijenhuis et al. 2008) demonstrating that subjects develop individual strategies to achieve control.\n\nLimitations\nThis pilot-study lacked a (double-blind) control group hence it cannot be ruled out that the effects were due to non-specific treatment effects as pointed out in previous studies (Lansbergen et al. 2011; Perreau-Linck et al. 2010). Furthermore, in contrast to most other studies, in this study neurofeedback was carried out as ‘treatment as usual’ and often patients had to pay out-of-pocket to cover the costs of neurofeedback. This might have potentially led to the higher ES as well. The comorbid depressive symptoms were only assessed in patients with initial deviating scores on the BDI and pre- and post-EEG and ERP’s were only collected in a sub-group of responders, which limits the generalizability of the findings in this study. Therefore, future controlled studies should assess scales such as the BDI in all subjects and conduct pre- and post-treatment EEG and ERPs in all subjects to replicate and confirm the findings from this study.\n\nFinally, calculating an ES based on pilot study data is not as reliable as calculating these on large RCT’s (Kraemer et al. 2006), hence caution should be taken in interpreting the ES reported in this study. The reported ES in Fig. 3 only provides a rough indication of the effects and an RCT is required to further substantiate this ES for QEEG informed neurofeedback.\n\nSummary\nThis pilot-study provides support for the possibility to personalize neurofeedback treatment to the individual QEEG using a limited set of decision rules whereby most patients are still treated with one of the well investigated neurofeedback protocols (SMR/Theta or Theta/Beta neurofeedback), resulting in high response rates and a relatively high ES on ATT. Furthermore, specific neurophysiological improvements (increased N200 and P300 ERP amplitudes and decreased SMR) were obtained in a sub-group of patients who were treated with SMR neurofeedback. Future studies employing randomized double-blind placebo controlled designs and larger sample sizes are required to replicate these findings. The decision rules employed in this study could be easily used for designing a study employing more objective means of QEEG-based protocol selection.\n\nGo to:\n\""}]}
