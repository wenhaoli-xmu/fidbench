{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "¿Puedes hacer un resumen de esta transcripción de un audio?\n\n56\n00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320\nAstro.\n\n57\n00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,720\nAstro es la nueva joya de la corona de desarrollo web.\n\n58\n00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,040\nBueno, al menos eso parece.\n\n59\n00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,560\nPorque Astro tiene una nueva versión estable 1.0\n\n60\n00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,160\ndesde agosto de 2022.\n\n61\n00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,160\nY sigue, sigue publicando nuevas versiones.\n\n62\n00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,600\nEn el momento de grabar esto, estamos en la 1.4.\n\n63\n00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,040\nAsí que sigue avanzando pasito a pasito.\n\n64\n00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,720\nAhora vamos a descubrir\n\n65\n00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840\nalgunas de sus principales características.\n\n66\n00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,920\nPero es gente muy lista,\n\n67\n00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,720\nes gente lista la que está detrás de este desarrollo,\n\n68\n00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,000\nporque su web ha ido evolucionando,\n\n69\n00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,840\na la vez que ha ido evolucionando también\n\n70\n00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,320\nlas capacidades que tiene de desarrollo.\n\n71\n00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320\nY ahora, si tú entras en la web,\n\n72\n00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,160\ntienes una captura que dice algo así como\n\n73\n00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,040\nRebuild my blog with Astro out of curiosity.\n\n74\n00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,280\nHolly...\n\n75\n00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,360\nSale como si fueran unas palabrotas, unos tacos.\n\n76\n00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,640\nO sea, alguien, bueno, en este caso el CEO de Pink Labs,\n\n77\n00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,880\nun tal Cio,\n\n78\n00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,800\nsaca una gráfica y dice\n\n79\n00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,640\nestoy reconstruyendo mi blog con Astro\n\n80\n00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,480\ny me ha llevado esta sorpresa.\n\n81\n00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,480\nEsto es una cosa espectacular.\n\n82\n00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,560\nUna expresión de júbilo,\n\n83\n00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,240\na la vez que de casi ofensa.\n\n84\n00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,880\nY es que antes estaba hecho con NETJS,\n\n85\n00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,520\nahora mismo el principal enemigo a batir\n\n86\n00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,720\nen este mundo de desarrollo web\n\n87\n00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,280\norientado hacia el Jamstack\n\n88\n00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,080\ny tiene 138 kilobytes de carga,\n\n89\n00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,880\nde carga de JavaScript.\n\n90\n00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,080\nY sale la comparativa con Astro y es un 7,6.\n\n91\n00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,920\nEs muy poquito en comparación.\n\n92\n00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600\nEs una diferencia muy grande.\n\n93\n00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,920\nY esa es una de las principales,\n\n94\n00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,040\nsi no la principal, característica de Astro\n\n95\n00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,840\ncon respecto a la competencia,\n\n96\n00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,720\na lo que había cuando empezaron a desarrollar Astro,\n\n97\n00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,240\nque es que quiere tener cero segment.\n\n98\n00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,320\nO sea, no quiere llevar al cliente, al navegador,\n\n99\n00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,160\nmás JavaScript del que sea estrictamente necesario.\n\n100\n00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960\nO sea, HTML, por favor.\n\n101\n00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,080\nQue el HTML es lo más rápido que se puede ejecutar en un navegador.\n\n102\n00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,360\nPone solo el JavaScript que necesite.\n\n103\n00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,560\nY además te invita,\n\n104\n00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,720\no vamos a ver cómo te invita\n\n105\n00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,600\no te permite tomar decisiones con respecto al JavaScript\n\n106\n00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,120\nque tú quieres que cargue.\n\n107\n00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,000\nO sea, te da mano en eso.\n\n108\n00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,480\nAhora tenemos ese detalle.\n\n109\n00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,640\nPero antes quiero pararme con algunos aspectos\n\n110\n00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,480\nque no son tan claros cuando tú entras en la web,\n\n111\n00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,000\npero para mí sí es bastante significativo.\n\n112\n00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,080\nY hay una diferencia fundamental con respecto a...\n\n113\n00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080\nYo diría que toda la competencia,\n\n114\n00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,440\ntoda, diría al 100% de la competencia,\n\n115\n00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,040\nun porcentaje muy pequeño de los entornos de desarrollo\n\n116\n00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,160\ntienen traducciones de la documentación al castellano.\n\n117\n00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,520\nY Astro sí que la tiene.\n\n118\n00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,920\nSí, hay algunos otros fringos que sí que tienen esa traducción,\n\n119\n00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,400\npero no es lo más habitual.\n\n120\n00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,480\nBueno, pues si te quieres sumergir en Astro en castellano,\n\n121\n00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,520\nes uno de los idiomas en los que su documentación,\n\n122\n00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,920\nno digo que está al completo,\n\n123\n00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,560\npero sí en un porcentaje no pequeño está traducida.\n\n124\n00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,360\nEstá traducida, así que es como un acercamiento mucho más liviano.\n\n125\n00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,720\nLos conceptos se pueden entender mejor.\n\n126\n00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,680\nY es que Astro quiere explicártelo bien.\n\n127\n00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,880\nA poco que profundices en la documentación,\n\n128\n00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,480\nte darás cuenta que dice, nosotros lo hacemos así.\n\n129\n00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,560\nSi lo quisieras hacer de esta otra forma,\n\n130\n00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,520\nsería más complicado. O no funciona,\n\n131\n00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,160\nporque nosotros hemos tomado esta decisión por ti.\n\n132\n00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280\nRecordar que Astro es un framework,\n\n133\n00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,360\npor tanto, toman decisiones por ti,\n\n134\n00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,280\notra cosa es que a ti te gusten o no.\n\n135\n00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,720\nY hay otro aspecto que también está en el menú,\n\n136\n00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,880\nque es la plantilla.\n\n137\n00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,680\nTiene un repositorio, a lo mejor no es muy grande,\n\n138\n00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,120\nsobre todo si viene desde el mundo de WordPress,\n\n139\n00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,440\nque es muy pequeño,\n\n140\n00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,600\no incluso de Wix o de Squarespace o de cualquier otro de estos lugares,\n\n141\n00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,760\npero en comparación con la competencia,\n\n142\n00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,400\ntambién está mejor planteado, en el sentido de que se vea a la primera,\n\n143\n00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,800\nque hay plantillas disponibles para que todo sea más llevadero.\n\n144\n00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,080\nAl final, y esto es una reflexión no solamente para Astro,\n\n145\n00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,760\nsino para todo tipo de desarrollo,\n\n146\n00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,240\nsi estás implicado en un desarrollo que quieres que la gente lo utilice,\n\n147\n00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,760\ntienes que tomar buena nota de esto, hay que hacer labor de marketing,\n\n148\n00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,840\nhay que presentar las cosas bonitas y, sobre todo, sencillas.\n\n149\n00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,160\nEntonces, si alguien quiere probar Astro, como hacía este tal Cio,\n\n150\n00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,400\nque estaba tan asombrado,\n\n151\n00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,160\nnecesitamos tener recursos que hagan que eso sea más fácil,\n\n152\n00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,760\ny una de esas cosas que invitan es tener varias plantillas para elegir,\n\n153\n00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,560\naunque luego no utilicemos ninguna,\n\n154\n00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,240\no aunque luego digamos, bueno, todo lo programa un mono.\n\n155\n00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,320\nPrefiero hacerlo yo.\n\n156\n00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,880\nMono con platillos, me refiero.\n\n157\n00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,080\nNo me gusta cómo está hecho esto, pero lo quiero hacer a mi manera.\n\n158\n00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,840\nPero la puerta de entrada se hace mucho más amplia.\n\n159\n00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,040\nAstro tiene soporte nativo para Markdown, antes de que me preguntéis.\n\n160\n00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,120\nO sea, ya directamente entiende este formato\n\n161\n00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,680\ny también entiende el formato MDX.\n\n162\n00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,880\nY, bueno, como veremos ahora, tiene algunas características más.\n\n163\n00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,960\nSí quiero detenerme en otro aspecto,\n\n164\n00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,200\ntampoco está reflejado aquí directamente en la página principal\n\n165\n00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,880\nde Astro.Build,\n\n166\n00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,760\nque si trabajáis con Visual Studio Code,\n\n167\n00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,640\nque entiendo que de alguna forma\n\n168\n00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,400\nprácticamente todo el mundo trabaja con esto, o con WebStorm,\n\n169\n00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,480\nsabemos que hay más, hay más ideas en el mercado,\n\n170\n00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,560\npero parece que Visual Studio Code es ahora, que marca bastante la pauta,\n\n171\n00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,080\nque sepáis que hay una extensión de Astro para Visual Studio Code\n\n172\n00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,360\nque facilita el trabajo con él.\n\n173\n00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,160\nBásicamente porque Astro propone su propia extensión,\n\n174\n00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,480\nvais a quedar flipados con el nombre de la extensión de fichero\n\n175\n00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,480\nque han propuesto, es.Astro.\n\n176\n00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,600\nY, bueno, pues nos va a permitir\n\n177\n00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,880\nque Visual Studio Code o cualquier otro editor,\n\n178\n00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,320\nsi tiene extensiones, lo he mirado, pero es probable que sí que los tenga,\n\n179\n00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,400\nporque al final quieren que más gente lo use.\n\n180\n00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,280\nBueno, pues que entienda esta extensión y entienda,\n\n181\n00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,720\ncomprenda cómo están construidos estos ficheros y para lo que sirven.\n\n182\n00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,680\nSi te adelanto, porque puede que te estalle un poco la cabeza,\n\n183\n00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,960\nque Astro lo que ha querido en esos ficheros\n\n184\n00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,800\nes recoger un poco la experiencia que se va teniendo con el mundo del Jamstack,\n\n185\n00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,680\ndonde claramente hay dos...\n\n186\n00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,280\nTodos los desarrollos se dividen en dos cosas.\n\n187\n00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,040\nUna es lo que ve el usuario, o sea, lo que...\n\n188\n00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,720\no lo que se va a convertir luego en el HTML estático,\n\n189\n00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,000\ny la otra es todo lo que necesitas, en este caso de JavaScript,\n\n190\n00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,560\npero en Hugo, por ejemplo, sería con Go, ¿no?\n\n191\n00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,160\nDependiendo del lenguaje de programación, en este estamos con JavaScript.\n\n192\n00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,360\nTodo lo que vas a necesitar de JavaScript para que se puedan presentar los datos.\n\n193\n00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,600\nEntonces, es como una división de markdown.\n\n194\n00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,160\nNo sé si habéis visto alguna vez el front matter.\n\n195\n00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,880\nFront matter es esa forma que implantó Jekyll, si no me equivoco,\n\n196\n00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,600\npara poder poner en la cabecera de un fichero markdown metadatos.\n\n197\n00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,680\nEntonces, pones unas líneas, unos guiones, arriba y abajo,\n\n198\n00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,880\ny eso es como que los editores de markdown todos entienden\n\n199\n00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,280\nque ahí hay como una especie de metadatos donde tienes clave valor.\n\n200\n00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400\nEn el caso de Astro, es con vitaminas,\n\n201\n00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,840\ny además puedes poner ahí código JavaScript.\n\n202\n00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960\nAsí de claro.\n\n203\n00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,120\nPor ejemplo, tengo uno aquí delante.\n\n204\n00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,440\nLet allPost igual a await Astro,\n\n205\n00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,240\nes la librería global, punto, glob,\n\n206\n00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,000\ny entonces hace una captura, o intenta hacer una captura\n\n207\n00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,880\nde todos los ficheros markdown de la carpeta post.\n\n208\n00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,680\nPara luego tener este allPost disponible en el resto del fichero.\n\n209\n00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800\nAsí, así te lo cuento.\n\n210\n00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,040\nYa habrá tiempo de profundizar,\n\n211\n00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,200\nte invito a hacerlo, nosotros lo vamos a hacer en el taller,\n\n212\n00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,840\npero al final van acoplando esas necesidades que se van viendo\n\n213\n00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,480\ny que en otros sistemas similares o que intentan llegar al mismo sitio,\n\n214\n00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,680\nsí se nota que, bueno, pues al final tú te tienes que buscar la vida,\n\n215\n00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,640\npor ejemplo, para que leas los ficheros markdown.\n\n216\n00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,280\nO esa combinación entre JavaScript, markdown, MDX,\n\n217\n00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,960\nque parece ya muy simple al principio,\n\n218\n00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,080\npues al final tiene una carga de código que tienes que generar tú,\n\n219\n00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,880\nque sí, lo puedes copiar y pegar de cualquier tutorial.\n\n220\n00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,200\nPero bueno, si al final lo que quieres es montar un blog,\n\n221\n00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,800\npues ¿por qué no te ahorran ese proceso?\n\n222\n00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920\nEs lo que piensa uno, ¿no?\n\n223\n00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,160\nDice, está muy bien, me aprendes, genial, estupendo,\n\n224\n00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,960\npero yo lo que quiero es ir al rano,\n\n225\n00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,640\nquiero aquí ver cómo funcionan los enlaces,\n\n226\n00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,360\nver cómo el rendimiento de la web al final.\n\n227\n00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,960\nAsí que, bueno, estas son algunas de las cosas que me parecen llamativas\n\n228\n00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,240\nantes de entrar a la chicha, al mogollón.\n\n229\n00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,240\nEn la web de Astro aparece enseguida\n\n230\n00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,880\ncuáles son las características principales que tiene.\n\n231\n00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,520\nEnfocado al contenido, esto es lo que acabo de decir,\n\n232\n00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,200\nAstro fue diseñado para sitios web ricos en contenido,\n\n233\n00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,520\npara que eso sea muy fácil de capturar.\n\n234\n00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,200\nEl servidor, lo primero.\n\n235\n00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,080\nLos sitios se ejecutan más rápido si no tienen JavaScript.\n\n236\n00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,320\nO sea, si partimos de un HTML más básico.\n\n237\n00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,720\nSi el HTML ya está en el servidor generado.\n\n238\n00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,840\nRápido, por defecto, dicen,\n\n239\n00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,040\nes imposible crear un sitio web lento con Astro.\n\n240\n00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,440\nBueno, déjalo en manos, déjalo en nuestras manos.\n\n241\n00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240\nVerás cómo somos capaces.\n\n242\n00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,120\nFácil de usar.\n\n243\n00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,240\nEllos dicen que no hace falta ser experto para desarrollar algo en Astro,\n\n244\n00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,240\nes verdad que es bastante limpio, pero bueno,\n\n245\n00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,240\nsi realmente no has nunca aterrizado\n\n246\n00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,240\npor el mundo del desarrollo web\n\n247\n00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,120\nen el contexto del mundo del Jamstack,\n\n248\n00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,240\npues algunos conceptos son intercambiables con otros frameworks,\n\n249\n00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360\npero hay que saber cuáles son.\n\n250\n00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,120\nY bueno, pues tiene más de 100 integraciones,\n\n251\n00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,320\nluego hablaremos un poco más sobre ellas.\n\n252\n00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,760\nAstro se basa en un tipo de arquitectura\n\n253\n00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,560\nque se llama Islands Architecture, o sea, la arquitectura de las islas,\n\n254\n00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,280\ny se han apropiado de ella, y aquí es donde viene,\n\n255\n00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,520\npara mí, el hecho que pueda hacer que esta herramienta\n\n256\n00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,040\nsea la joya de la corona, y hemos llegado a ese punto, ¿no?\n\n257\n00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,520\nPorque lo que hace es que esas islas aisladas\n\n258\n00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,760\ny que forman parte de nuestra arquitectura sean componentes.\n\n259\n00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,720\nEntonces, en vez de tener una web,\n\n260\n00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,360\nuna single-page application, por ejemplo,\n\n261\n00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,800\no bueno, una aplicación de otro tipo,\n\n262\n00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920\npero para que nos hagamos una idea, una SPA,\n\n263\n00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,720\ndonde todo va incrustado dentro de esa aplicación,\n\n264\n00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,120\npues lo que quiere, o lo que propone Astro,\n\n265\n00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,520\nes que cada pieza, cada uno de esos componentes\n\n266\n00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,120\nesté generado por JavaScript de forma independiente.\n\n267\n00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,240\nO sea, en vez de tener un bundle con toda la aplicación, no.\n\n268\n00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,920\nTú dices, pues mira, yo aquí quiero poner un formulario,\n\n269\n00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,200\nyo aquí quiero poner un contador,\n\n270\n00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,400\nyo aquí, o sea, darle al botón, incrementar y incrementar,\n\n271\n00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,040\nyo quiero aquí poner aquí un slider que hace algo específico,\n\n272\n00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,840\no otro bloque que sea un tracker\n\n273\n00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,160\nde las últimas cotizaciones del blockchain,\n\n274\n00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,600\nme lo invento, ¿no?\n\n275\n00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,240\nY que cada uno se comporte de forma diferente.\n\n276\n00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,520\nO sea, como que estás creando pequeñas aplicaciones\n\n277\n00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,040\nque luego vas a incrustar en ese punto Astro,\n\n278\n00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,920\nen ese fichero global donde vas a meter esas piezas\n\n279\n00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,760\nen el sitio adecuado, porque Astro te va a permitir,\n\n280\n00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,920\ncomo os decía antes, en esa parte primera de ese fichero\n\n281\n00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,040\nte va a permitir cargarlo, te va a permitir cargarlo.\n\n282\n00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,360\nY esta es la maravilla que hace que Astro sea compatible\n\n283\n00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,520\ncon React, con Vue, con Preact, con LIT,\n\n284\n00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,800\ncon AlpineJS, con Solid y con Svelte.\n\n285\n00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,200\nCreo que no me he dejado ninguna, las tenía por aquí delante.\n\n286\n00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,200\nO sea, es compatible con varios frameworks,\n\n287\n00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,880\nporque, claro, cada una se hace, cada aplicación se hace por su cuenta.\n\n288\n00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,200\nImaginados si trabajáis en un equipo grande\n\n289\n00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,920\ny cada parte del equipo, o son muchas personas,\n\n290\n00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,000\no lo tenéis de forma muy distribuida,\n\n291\n00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,080\ny cada parte del equipo se experta en algo diferente.\n\n292\n00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,840\nEvidentemente existen otras formas de orquestar esto,\n\n293\n00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,160\npero la que propone Astro es decir,\n\n294\n00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,760\nbueno, pues hay un equipo, hay unas gentes que lo hacen en React,\n\n295\n00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,080\notras lo hacen en Vue, otras lo hacen en Svelte,\n\n296\n00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,360\nnosotros lo que podemos hacer es algo que aglutine eso.\n\n297\n00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,720\nEvidentemente, evidentemente,\n\n298\n00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840\nesto hará que sea la aplicación más grande,\n\n299\n00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,800\nquizás innecesariamente grande,\n\n300\n00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,880\npero puede que también estés en un caso como podría estar yo,\n\n301\n00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,280\nque es, bueno, tienes hecho un desarrollo\n\n302\n00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,920\ncon lo que ya conoces, con Vue, con React, con lo que te guste,\n\n303\n00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,120\npero hay algo que te viene hecho\n\n304\n00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,240\no que tú puedes insertar directamente en tu web\n\n305\n00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,080\ny te hace mucha ilusión, que sea, por ejemplo, una pizarra en blanco,\n\n306\n00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,480\ny has encontrado un script maravilloso\n\n307\n00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,960\nque alguien ha desarrollado, ha puesto en Open Source\n\n308\n00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,920\ny lo quieres incorporar ahí, pero tu web está hecha entera en Vue\n\n309\n00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,200\ny eso está hecho en React.\n\n310\n00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,160\nEn el mundo que conocíamos hasta ahora,\n\n311\n00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,760\nera más difícil hacer que estas piezas encajaran,\n\n312\n00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,920\nevidentemente ya se podía.\n\n313\n00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,840\nAstro no ha venido a decirnos aquí\n\n314\n00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,840\ncomo que esto era imposible,\n\n315\n00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,120\npero nos da las piezas para que sea mucho más sencillo.\n\n316\n00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,760\nO sea, que esa parte conviene de tenerla en cuenta,\n\n317\n00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,960\npero es independiente.\n\n318\n00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,280\nEs independiente de si tú quieres\n\n319\n00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,440\nque complicate tanto la vida o es por una cuestión de necesidad.\n\n320\n00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,960\nAsí que quedémonos con eso.\n\n321\n00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,640\nCada componente es una mini aplicación independiente\n\n322\n00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,320\ny Astro se va a encargar de orquestar todo eso\n\n323\n00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,960\npara que al final el usuario lo vea en pantalla.\n\n324\n00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,920\nPero esto tiene una segunda parte.\n\n325\n00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,320\nEsto tiene una segunda parte.\n\n326\n00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,440\nHay algo que sí conviene reseñar,\n\n327\n00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,080\nporque esto es muy propio del Jamstack\n\n328\n00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,880\ny seguro que si ya tienes experiencia te lo estarás preguntando,\n\n329\n00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,440\nque es el Server Side Rendering.\n\n330\n00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,920\nO sea, ese renderizado de HTML\n\n331\n00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,680\nque se hace del lado del servidor\n\n332\n00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,440\no que se hace, por ejemplo, en tu local\n\n333\n00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,800\ncuando ejecutas una build\n\n334\n00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,440\ny ejecutas una HTML de salida,\n\n335\n00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,720\nAstro está preparado para esto.\n\n336\n00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,240\nPero también tiene una serie de adaptadores\n\n337\n00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,560\npara que lo que tú generes se pueda renderizar\n\n338\n00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,600\ncon Node.js, con Deno, con Vercel, con Netlify.\n\n339\n00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,160\nY es curioso cómo hace esa forma de abstraerse,\n\n340\n00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,000\nde hacerse agnóstico incluso a los sistemas\n\n341\n00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,400\nque son los que generan ese HTML en el servidor.\n\n342\n00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,240\nAsí que a mí me parece muy significativo.\n\n343\n00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,880\nDe hecho, creo que un poco explorado incluso por mi parte\n\n344\n00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,440\nesas capacidades y el hecho de entender\n\n345\n00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,640\nque, por ejemplo, Node.js está casado con Vercel,\n\n346\n00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,440\naunque tú lo puedas desplegar en otros sitios,\n\n347\n00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,760\npero ellos quieren que esto sea agnóstico.\n\n348\n00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,280\nComo por delante, o sea, la parte del frontend,\n\n349\n00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,880\ntanto como por detrás,\n\n350\n00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,800\nsi pensamos que el backend está en la parte de atrás,\n\n351\n00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,080\ncon la parte del desarrollo y la evolución.\n\n352\n00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,560\nPero aquí aterrizamos, todo esto,\n\n353\n00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,840\nlo quería explicar porque aquí aterrizamos\n\n354\n00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,080\nen la parte donde tú tomas la palabra.\n\n355\n00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,400\nY llegamos a la progressive hydration,\n\n356\n00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,440\nla hidratación progresiva,\n\n357\n00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,760\nsi quieres entenderlo con una traducción al castellano.\n\n358\n00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,040\nAquí es donde la magia de Astro se une\n\n359\n00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,240\ny donde entran en la combinación las partes que os he explicado antes,\n\n360\n00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,040\ntanto la arquitectura de islas\n\n361\n00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,160\ncomo los componentes renderizados en el servidor.\n\n362\n00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,960\nComo hemos quedado,\n\n363\n00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,760\ntu página está dividida en unas aplicaciones,\n\n364\n00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,200\nmini aplicaciones,\n\n365\n00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,880\ncada componente puede ser una mini aplicación hecha\n\n366\n00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,160\nen su propio JavaScript, incluso en Vanilla, evidentemente,\n\n367\n00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,720\ny además, generadas en el servidor,\n\n368\n00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,720\nSSSR que hemos visto.\n\n369\n00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,600\nEntonces, nos queda decir, bueno, ya, pero yo, por ejemplo,\n\n370\n00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,880\nquiero que la gente pueda interactuar,\n\n371\n00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,800\n¿de qué me vale tener un botón para incrementar y decrementar un contador\n\n372\n00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,040\nsi no funciona?\n\n373\n00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,680\nPorque de momento no hemos hablado de desplegar JavaScript.\n\n374\n00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,560\nBueno, pues es aquí donde tú puedes tomar la decisión\n\n375\n00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,640\ny decir que un componente tiene unos atributos especiales\n\n376\n00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,200\ncuando estás trabajando en Astro,\n\n377\n00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,160\nese componente se despliegue en clientes de la forma normal\n\n378\n00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,040\ncomo se han desplegado en el JavaScript siempre,\n\n379\n00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,160\nque es toda esa funcional JavaScript que se cargue cuando se carga la HTML\n\n380\n00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,040\npara que pueda manipular el DOM\n\n381\n00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,560\ny cuando tú aprietas ese botón de incrementar o decrementar,\n\n382\n00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,600\nel numerito vaya cambiando.\n\n383\n00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,840\nPero ellos han ido más allá y, por ejemplo,\n\n384\n00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,880\notra de las cosas que puedes hacer es que tú tienes un formulario\n\n385\n00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200\nen el pie de la página.\n\n386\n00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,640\nEse formulario puede tener un JavaScript asociado\n\n387\n00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,840\npara que cuando el usuario meta su correo electrónico,\n\n388\n00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,040\nreciba un mensaje de confirmación y haga una redirección\n\n389\n00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,160\no le apunte a otro sitio, salga un pop-up o confetti.\n\n390\n00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,320\nBueno, ahí hay una carga de JavaScript, eso es evidente.\n\n391\n00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,240\n¿Por qué no cargar eso solo cuando el usuario llegue a esa parte\n\n392\n00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,920\ny no desplegar más JavaScript del necesario?\n\n393\n00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,800\nBueno, pues hay otra forma, otro pequeño atributo,\n\n394\n00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,520\nIDLE se llama, donde tú cargas el...\n\n395\n00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,720\nBueno, he dicho que se llama IDLE,\n\n396\n00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,320\npero a lo mejor no s�� si estoy hablando de memoria\n\n397\n00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,240\ny ahora mismo no lo tengo delante.\n\n398\n00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,600\nEse componente es el JavaScript que despliega ese componente\n\n399\n00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,000\npara que esa funcionalidad esté disponible\n\n400\n00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,800\ncuando el usuario hace algo con ese formulario en HTML.\n\n401\n00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,440\nBueno, pues se cargue solo cuando el usuario llegue ahí,\n\n402\n00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,960\ncuando haya hecho el scroll y llegue a esa parte.\n\n403\n00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,680\nAsí que toda esa carga de JavaScript\n\n404\n00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,600\nsolamente le va a aterrizar al usuario cuando llegue ahí.\n\n405\n00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,960\nMe imagino que utilizará el Intersection Observer\n\n406\n00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,880\npara poder hacer esa combinación.\n\n407\n00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,280\nEsto, sin duda, a mí es algo que me parece esencial\n\n408\n00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,960\npara que tenga un nivel de competencia con respecto a otros sistemas.\n\n409\n00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,560\nMás allá de la complejidad que podemos buscarnos\n\n410\n00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,000\ny nos metemos en decir,\n\n411\n00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,960\npues este componente lo hago en esta librería,\n\n412\n00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,160\nesto es Vanilla, esto es React, esto es Nervell.\n\n413\n00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,280\nMás allá de eso, también utilizarlo de forma inteligente.\n\n414\n00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,240\nEl HTML sigue siendo HTML.\n\n415\n00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,760\nLe damos propiedades dinámicas allá donde nos conviene\n\n416\n00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,320\ny además lo podemos desplegar según quiera.\n\n417\n00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,280\nUna de las cosas que también podéis ver en la documentación\n\n418\n00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,840\nes que tiene varios componentes,\n\n419\n00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,480\nya lo he ido explicando, varias integraciones,\n\n420\n00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,600\ntanto con los frameworks de UI como los adaptadores de SSR,\n\n421\n00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,640\npero también tienes un módulo hecho en casa,\n\n422\n00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,400\nun componente, una extensión para trabajar con imágenes,\n\n423\n00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,960\npara trabajar con MDX,\n\n424\n00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080\npara tener también acceso a Tailwind,\n\n425\n00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,680\npara generar un sitemap y un montón de cosas.\n\n426\n00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,080\nPero más de uno, quizás ya los que estéis más en modo hardcore\n\n427\n00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200\ncon todo esto del desarrollo,\n\n428\n00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320\nestaréis pensando, ¿vale? Muy bien.\n\n429\n00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,560\nDani, me has contado esto de que son mini aplicaciones,\n\n430\n00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,680\nque son islas, claro, pero las islas entre sí no se comunican, ¿no?\n\n431\n00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,280\n¿Cómo podemos hacer que las islas tengan una comunicación entre ellas?\n\n432\n00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,680\nBien, Astro resuelve esto echando balones fuera\n\n433\n00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,440\ny diciendo que en este contexto\n\n434\n00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,560\npodemos comunicar unos componentes con otros\n\n435\n00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,000\nutilizando una librería de terceros que se llama NanoStore.\n\n436\n00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,960\nEs una librería agnóstica,\n\n437\n00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,680\ntambién no se casa con ningún framework\n\n438\n00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,200\ny nos va a permitir combinar la información\n\n439\n00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,600\nde unos componentes y otros para que sepan en qué estado está.\n\n440\n00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,480\nLa verdad es que en JavaScript, según han ido pasando los años,\n\n441\n00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,200\nme he dado cuenta que el punto clave de todo es controlar el estado.\n\n442\n00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,040\nTener la fuente única de verdad para que nos diga\n\n443\n00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,040\nsi el usuario tiene abierto el pop-up o cerrado,\n\n444\n00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,240\no si ha pulsado el botón o no lo ha cerrado.\n\n445\n00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,760\nEstas cosas, cuando es un pequeño tutorial,\n\n446\n00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,720\nuna pequeña guía está muy bien, pero cuando tenemos cientos de cosas\n\n447\n00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,120\nque controlar, que no es broma,\n\n448\n00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,880\nque enseguida llegan las cientos de cosas a controlar,\n\n449\n00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000\npues ¿por qué no poder hacer un control exhaustivo de ese estado\n\n450\n00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,120\ny saber siempre cómo se va a mostrar al usuario\n\n451\n00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,360\nel siguiente paso, el paso en el que está?\n\n452\n00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,160\nAsí que estas NanoStore, que están recomendadas en esta librería,\n\n453\n00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,840\nque la verdad es que tienen muy buena pinta,\n\n454\n00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,760\nes muy pequeñita, menos de un kilobyte,\n\n455\n00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,000\nno tiene dependencias y es la que te recomienda Astro\n\n456\n00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,600\npara que trabajes el estado combinado entre componentes.\n\n457\n00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,520\nPara acabar, bueno, puede ser este Astro un competidor real\n\n458\n00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,760\ndel que ahora aparece todo poderoso e inexpugnable en NES-JS.\n\n459\n00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,680\nYo creo que sí, aunque evidentemente los que están habituados\n\n460\n00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,280\nen desarrollar en React, que es un montón de gente,\n\n461\n00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,440\ny la popularidad que tiene NES-JS es difícil de desbancar.\n\n462\n00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,840\nAl final, en el mundo del software siempre aparece el mismo modelo.\n\n463\n00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,760\nAparece un modelo de una compañía o de un equipo\n\n464\n00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,400\nque desarrolla un framework, una librería,\n\n465\n00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,840\nque hace que todo sea muy fácil, pero que te tengas que casar de alguna forma\n\n466\n00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,240\ncon algunas convenciones que hacen, que puede que te gusten o no,\n\n467\n00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,640\nen el caso de NES-JS, utilizar React y estar favorecido\n\n468\n00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,440\nel hecho de utilizar Vercel, que es la compañía que está detrás,\n\n469\n00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,960\npara hacer esos despliegues en su infraestructura.\n\n470\n00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,400\nY luego está el otro modelo, que es el modelo libre,\n\n471\n00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,200\nel que no se quiere casar con nadie, el que quiere pensar en ti,\n\n472\n00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,560\nen el developer, para que hagas las cosas que tú quieres hacer,\n\n473\n00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,400\ntomes tus decisiones, pero luego tú te encargas,\n\n474\n00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,200\ncomo si quieres hacer un adaptador propio y desplegarlo,\n\n475\n00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,600\nque sería un PHP, no sé si alguien tiene esa idea en la cabeza.\n\n476\n00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,920\nEntonces, Astro camina por esa parte,\n\n477\n00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,640\ncon lo cual es una competencia directa, aunque habrá que ver cómo evoluciona.\n\n478\n00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,320\nDesde luego, el hecho de que Astro siga sacando nuevas versiones,\n\n479\n00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,520\nconsigue rondas de financiación,\n\n480\n00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,640\ny en el fondo sigue teniendo una actividad grande,\n\n481\n00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,480\nhará que crezca su comunidad, que crezcan los casos de uso,\n\n482\n00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,080\ndonde se ha utilizado Astro para desarrollar aplicaciones\n\n483\n00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,560\ncada vez más complejas, y yo creo que va a ir encontrando su hueco.\n\n484\n00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,520\nVa a ir encontrando su hueco porque irá escuchando las necesidades\n\n485\n00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,280\ny tendrá ventaja con respecto a sus competidores,\n\n486\n00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,400\nno solamente en el JS, por el hecho de que apareció después.\n\n487\n00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,560\nY como todos los frameworks y todas las librerías y todo el software\n\n488\n00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,720\nque aparece después, juega con las cartas un poco más marcadas,\n\n489\n00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,960\nporque sí sabe por dónde empezar, porque conoce mejor las necesidades\n\n490\n00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,680\nde los que nosotros queremos tener.\n\n491\n00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,640\nAsí que nada, te invito a probar Astro.\n\n492\n00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,320\nSi eres suscriptor de web activa, podrás también acceder a ese taller,\n\n493\n00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:19,080\ny espero que te guste y que te animes a probarlo.\n\n494\n00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,680\nLo decía al principio, toda apuesta tecnológica por un producto de software\n\n495\n00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,560\nque tiene muy poco tiempo de evolución, tiene más riesgo que cuando\n\n496\n00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,480\napuestas por algo que lleva años y años de evolutivo,\n\n497\n00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,600\ndonde ya se han resuelto un montón de circunstancias y errores posibles.\n\n498\n00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,760\nEs evidente que eso está ahí, pero también es cierto que se abren puertas\n\n499\n00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,080\nque uno a lo mejor no espera, y desarrollos que parecían que podían quedarse\n\n500\n00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,120\nen una versión 0.03 alfa toda una vida, como ha pasado en muchas ocasiones\n\n501\n00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,000\ny aún así nos hemos atrevido a utilizar en producción, pues llegan a la versión 1.0,\n\n502\n00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,640\n1.4, creo que estaba ahora, como Astro, y te van presentando\n\n503\n00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,560\ny te van poniendo el caramelito de delante para que juegues con él,\n\n504\n00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,640\ny en función de eso decidas si lo quieres utilizar o no.\n\n505\n00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,200\nPuede ser una buena apuesta y quizás hasta te solvente algún problema.\n"}]}

We are driven by our vision to “Build Hong Kong as a Playful City”. The basic principles behind the Playful City Framework are that every child is recognised as a valued, respected citizen, and every child is engaged to express or participate in decisions to play. Through our programmes, services, and advocacy work, we seek societal commitment to meet the play needs of every child at policy, planning and provision level. Come join our team of playworkers, hospital play specialists, and playground consultants.\n‘Value Children, Value Play’ – that’s the motto.\n2\tJob Description\n2.1\tHospital Play Services\nHospital play refers to activities and programs that are specifically designed for children who are hospitalized. These activities may include play, recreation, and education and are intended to provide a sense of normalcy and support the emotional well-being of hospitalized children. Hospital play programs may include activities such as arts and crafts, games, music, and storytelling and may be provided by trained play specialists, volunteers, or other members of the healthcare team. Hospital play programs are often tailored to the needs and interests of individual children, and may be adjusted to accommodate different age groups, developmental levels, and medical conditions. The goal of hospital play is to help children cope with the stress and uncertainty of being in the hospital and to provide them with enjoyable and engaging activities that can support their overall health and well-being.\nPlayright provides Hospital Play Services at six public hospitals, closely collaborating with healthcare professionals to provide psychosocial support to hospitalised children by using various PLAY interventions throughout their patient pathway. We support the child, their family and the medical team to strengthen holistic paediatric care and mitigate the stress and potential trauma that hospitalised and sick children may experience.\n2.2\tJob Duties & Responsibilities:\n1)\tWork collaboratively with the Clinical and Training Managers to support case management, professional development, policies, manuals, and toolkits for art & leisure.\n2)\tPlan and monitor resources for meeting the project outputs and outcomes.\n3)\tDesign the manpower structure, including assessing risks and discussing with the supervisor and senior team members, to maximise talent, productivity and strategic planning.\n4)\tSupervise daily project activities in art & leisure and service operation, including budgeting and evaluation, also the administrative and managerial duties, including reporting and budgeting.\n5)\tProvide guidance and mentorship to the team, facilitate personal and professional growth, and contribute to training on psychosocial aspects of hospitalised children and their families to other healthcare professionals, parents and public in general.\n6)\tDevelop strong communication and work collaboration with key stakeholders, including funder(s), hospital management, healthcare professionals, and community partners and participate in networking.\n7)\tSupport advocacy work for the welfare of child patients and fund-raising events as needed, such as writing articles for service’s newsletter.\n8)\tPerform any ad hoc Hospital Play projects as assigned by the supervisor.\n\n2.3\tRequirements\n1)\tDegree holder in either discipline of Psychology, Nursing, Child Care, Social Work or Education\n2)\tMin. 5 years’ relevant experience work experience in project management\n3)\tLove to work or play with children\n4)\tExperience in serving special needs children is a plus\n\n2.4\tOther Benefits:\n1)\t5-day work week with flexible work hours\n2)\tTransportation Allowance\n3)\tMedical insurance\n4)\tTraining opportunities\n \nAbout Playright\n3\tVision\nTo build a society that respects, protects and fulfills a Child’s Right to Play, where children can enjoy their childhood.\n4\tMission\nTo advocate the value of play and seek societal commitment to meet the play needs of every child at policy, planning and provision level.\n5\tValues\n1)\tProfessional: Mastering knowledge of play, possessing abundant experiences, putting theories into practice, professionalism, professional ethics, professional competency\n2)\tPassionate: Child-centred, persevere, forward-looking, challenge taker, achieving goals at whatever costs\n3)\tEmpowering: Sharing with partners, equipping professionals, enhancing the network of play\n6\tHong Kong\nAmid rapid urbanisation in Hong Kong, there is a lack of space and resources for meaningful play especially among underprivileged children and families.\nTo address this unfulfilled need, Playright advocates children’s need and right to play and aims to create quality playspace and play experience for ALL children in our city.\n7\tLeader’s Message\n7.1\tOur future is our children, and our children’s future is the present!\nIt is the shared responsibility of the Government and society to take collective actions to make Hong Kong fit for our children. There is an urgent need to have a total review of our child-related system from policy, strategic planning, organisation and services provision levels using a right-based, life-course and ecological approach. Playright’s mandate to advocate children’s play is firmly rooted in the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989. Children’s play should be non-compulsory, driven by intrinsic motivations and undertaken for its own sake. Through our services and programmes, we demonstrate the value of play that is led by children. Nevertheless, to make play advocacy sustainable and scalable, empowering adults and professionals, as well as building partnerships are essential. We are glad to see wider recognition of play. I hope more people and groups will join us to make Hong Kong a better place for our children.\n(by Dr Chow Chun-bong, BBS, JP, Honorary Advisor of Playright Children’s Play Association)\n7.2\tLet’s build Hong Kong to be a Playful City!\nWe are driven by our vision to “Build Hong Kong as a Playful City,” a vision set out on our 30th birthday. The basic principles behind the Playful City Framework are that every child is recognised as a valued, respected citizen, and every child is engaged to express or participate in decisions to play.\nWe want to inspire our community to focus on four areas: namely, Playable Space, Play Provision, Play Time and Playful Adult. We are excited about these initiatives and we are grateful to our long-term and new partners who share our vision and support our work. We will work together with all stakeholders, learning from international best practices, in advocating the landscape of play in Hong Kong.\nThis is not only for children; but also for ALL children and citizens of all ages—meaning you and me.\n(by Anita Ma Wai-man, Chairperson of Playright Children’s Play Association)\n7.3\tLimitations to Play in a Society\nThere are many ways in which countries or societies can violate or undermine the right of children to play. Some examples include:\n1)\tLack of access to safe and accessible playgrounds and other recreational spaces: In some countries, children may not have access to safe and accessible playgrounds and other recreational spaces where they can engage in play and recreational activities. This can be due to a lack of funding for playgrounds, the absence of laws and regulations to protect children’s right to play, or other factors.\n2)\tOverly structured and adult-directed play: In some cases, children may be discouraged from engaging in free and imaginative play, and instead are expected to participate in overly structured and adult-directed activities. This can deprive children of the opportunity to develop their own interests and skills, and to explore and learn through play.\n3)\tHigh levels of violence and conflict: In some societies, high levels of violence and conflict can make it unsafe for children to play outside or engage in other forms of outdoor play. This can have a negative impact on children’s physical and emotional well-being, as well as their ability to engage in play and other recreational activities.\n4)\tEconomic inequality: Economic inequality can also impact children’s ability to play and engage in recreational activities. For example, children from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have access to the same opportunities for play and recreation as children from more privileged families. This can create disparities in children’s access to play, and can have negative long-term effects on their development and well-being.\nOverall, there are many ways in which countries and societies can violate or undermine children’s right to play. It is important for governments and other stakeholders to take steps to protect and promote this right, in order to support the overall development and well-being of children.\n8\tEstablished in 1987\nPlayright Children’s Play Association (Playright) is a charity founded by Mrs Marden and other co-founders in 1987 in Hong Kong. Rooted in Hong Kong for several decades, Playright has all along pursued the mission of advocating children’s play because we “Value Children, Value Play.”\n9\tSafeguard Article 31 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child\nAccording to the Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), all children have the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child, and to participate fully in cultural life and artistic life.\n9.1.1\tThe Convention on the Rights of the Child\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child is an international treaty that was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1989. It sets out the rights that are to be afforded to children, including the right to education, healthcare, protection from violence and exploitation, and the right to participate in cultural and artistic activities. The Convention is the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history, with all but two member states of the United Nations have ratified it. It is also the only human rights treaty that provides for the participation of children in decision-making processes that affect them.\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises the right of every child to engage in play and leisure activities, which are essential for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral, and social development. Article 31 of the Convention states that “State Parties recognise the right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and the arts.” The Convention also recognises the importance of play in promoting the physical and mental health of children and in fostering their creativity and imagination. It calls on States Parties to provide children with the necessary facilities and opportunities to engage in play and recreational activities and to take appropriate measures to protect children from harmful forms of work that may interfere with their right to play.\nIn addition to recognising the right of children to play, the Convention also emphasises the importance of play in children's overall development and well-being. Article 29 of the Convention states that education should be directed towards “the development of the child’s personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential.” Play is an essential part of this process, as it can help children develop their physical, social, emotional and cognitive skills.\n9.1.2\tThe basis from the ten principles outlined in the European Association for Children in Hospital (EACH) Charter\n1)\tChildren should only be admitted to the hospital if the care they need cannot be provided at home or daily.\n2)\tChildren in the hospital have the right to have their parents or parent substitutes with them at all times.\n3)\tParents should be offered accommodation and should not incur additional costs or suffer loss of income. They should be kept informed about ward routine and their active participation should be encouraged.\n4)\tChildren and parents have the right to be informed in a manner appropriate to their age and understanding, and steps should be taken to mitigate physical and emotional stress.\n5)\tChildren and parents have the right to informed participation in all decisions involving their health care, and every child should be protected from unnecessary medical treatment and investigation.\n6)\tChildren should be cared for together with other children who have the same developmental needs, and there should be no age restrictions for visitors to children in the hospital.\n7)\tChildren should have full opportunity for play, recreation, and education suited to their age and condition, and should be in an environment designed, furnished, staffed, and equipped to meet their needs.\n8)\tChildren should be cared for by staff with the training and skills necessary to respond to their physical, emotional, and developmental needs.\n9)\tContinuity of care should be ensured by the team caring for children.\n10)\tChildren should be treated with tact and understanding, and their privacy should be respected at all times.\n10\tPromote the Development of Children’s Play\nWe hope to create free play for each and every child during their growth, and equip adults with knowledge about children’s play to satisfy every child’s needs for play through the following work: arranging play services, conducting assessment of play needs, organising play activities, creating play resources, operating play spaces, developing professional training on play, launching new play projects, providing safety assessment and consultancy services in play environments, promoting the development of local inclusive play spaces, promoting child participation, conducting research and surveys, as well as promotion and advocacy work.\n11\tBeneficiaries\nIn 2019-20, the number of beneficiaries receiving our services reached 229,630 and the number of beneficiaries receiving our training was 10,179. Amongst them, there are children, parents, teachers, community partners, and professionals from the medical and design fields.\n12\tFuture Development\nFor the future decade, we aim to turn Hong Kong into a “Playful City” where every playground will be safe, accessible, playful and inclusive for all; every hospital with a Paediatric department will include a hospital play service; child-led community play spaces will be available in 18 districts all over Hong Kong and free play time will be extended from kindergartens to all early childhood settings and primary schools, regardless of ability levels.\nMilestones\n1987 – Estbalishment of Playright\n1989 – HK’s 1st accessible playground in King’s Park with Urban Council was established\n1993 - Published research of ‘Hospital Play Services in Hong Kong’; Opened a reference library; and created playground in Hei Ling Chau and Chi Ma Wan Detention Centre\n1994 – International Play Association Asia Pacific Regional Play Conference; Launch service at Queen Mary Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital and Kwong Wah Hospital\n1995 – Jointly officer ‘Certificate in Hospital Play Specialists Training’; Research release seminar ‘Play Behaviour in Public Housing Estate Playgrounds’; Play service set up at Tai Lan Centre for Women\n1996 – Housing Play Scheme of residential estates with Sun Hung Kai Properties\n1997 – 1st strategic plan established; Research release cum seminar on ‘A New Chapter in Paediatric Healthcare’; Opening of HK’s 1st Play Resources Centre at Kwai Chung; Hospital play outreach programme for pre-schools\n1998 – Regular inspection of all playground facilites of Hong Kong Housing Authority\n1999 – ‘Adventure Play Festival’ in Victoria Park\n2000 – Playground safety inspection course by RoSPA UK and expert from USA;“PlayStreet” in Charter Road; Station at school to organise play\n2001 – Manage and operate the toy library of HK Central Library; Release research on “Children’s Play from Perspective of Toy Library Users”\n2002 – Change the name from “Playright Children’s Playground Association” to “Playright Children’s Play Association”; Design a friendly environment for Caritas Medical Centre; ‘Adventure Playpark’ in Ma On Shan Park; Service to discharged child patients with chronic illnesses\n2003 – Join the Alliance for a Children’s Commission; Play packs for hospitalised children and those quarantined in campsites during the SARS period\n2004 – Discussion of the setup of a Children’s Commission; Launch Playmobile service; ‘Small Space.

Play is driven by intrinsic motivations and undertaken for its own sake, rather than as a means to an end. Play may take infinite forms but the key characteristics of play are fun, uncertainty, challenge, and flexibility.\n26\tWhy Should Children Play? \n26.1\tChildren’s Right\nAs stated in the Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: “all children have the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child and to participate freely in cultural life and artistic life.”\n26.2\tGlobal Concern\nThe adverse effects of inadequate play on children’s growth are not only affecting Hong Kong, but also prevail around the globe. The worrisome phenomenon has aroused global concern. Hence, in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development passed by the United Nations in 2015, most of the 17 goals stipulated are related to children’s play.\nHong Kong should not fall behind.\n26.2.1\t2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a plan of action adopted by the United Nations in 2015. It consists of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) that aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all people.\nSome of the goals and targets that relate to children include:\n1)\tGoal 1: End poverty in all its forms. Target 1.2: Reduce the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.\n2)\tGoal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. Target 4.1: Ensure that by 2030 all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care, and preprimary education so that they are ready for primary education.\n3)\tGoal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. Target 16.2: End abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and all forms of violence against and torture of children.\n27\tBenefits of Play\nA lot of research conducted in the past pointed out the benefits and values of play, including physical development, sociability and communication, cognitive thinking, incubating creativity, expressing emotions, nurturing concentration ability, problem solving, self-understanding, taking challenges, building self-confidence etc. As explained in detail in the thesis issued by the International Play Association in 2014, play is crucial in the development and growth of children. The thesis titled “Power of Play” issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2018 also restated the importance of play, and even advised doctors to use “play” as a new prescription to promote children’s health.\n27.1\tThe Power of Play thesis\nThe “Power of Play” thesis provides guidance to doctors on how to incorporate play into their practice and promote play in children’s daily lives. The thesis recommends that doctors:\n1)\tEducate parents and caregivers about the importance of play and the benefits it provides for children’s development and well-being.\n2)\tEncourage parents and caregivers to create opportunities for play in their child’s daily routine, including structured play activities and unstructured playtime.\n3)\tHelp parents and caregivers to understand the different types of play and their benefits, such as imaginative play, physical play, and social play.\n4)\tAdvise parents and caregivers to limit the use of screen time and other sedentary activities, and to encourage their children to engage in regular physical activity through play.\n5)\tProvide guidance to parents and caregivers on how to support their child’s play, including how to facilitate and encourage play, how to provide a safe play environment, and how to respond to their child’s play.\n6)\tEncourage parents and caregivers to play with their children, as this can help to strengthen the parent-child bond and provide opportunities for bonding and social interaction.\n\nThe thesis also recommends that doctors:\n1)\tUse play as a therapeutic tool to help children cope with stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues.\n2)\tUse play to help children develop their cognitive, physical, emotional, and social skills.\n3)\tUse play as a way to diagnose and assess children’s development, behavior, and mental health.\n4)\tUse play as a way to prescribe and promote healthy habits and behaviors, such as regular physical activity and healthy eating.\nProfessional Work\n28\tPlay & Playwork\nFor the healthy growth of children, play should be an integral part of children’s life at school, at home and in the community. To achieve the above, play opportunities and adults’ support are crucial. Playright’s Play and Playwork hub strives to create play and satisfy the needs of every child through a variety of demonstrations and empowerment, including organising activities, arrangement of professional training, provision of play resources and operation of play spaces.\nIn future decade, we aim to extend free play time from kindergartens to all early childhood settings, special schools and primary schools, and to make child-led community play spaces available in 18 districts all over Hong Kong.\n28.1\tPlay in School\nChildren start their schooling at an early age. Hence, it would be ideal if play could be integrated into their school life. Starting from 2011, we have introduced play in special schools. Through demonstration, training for teachers, on-site consultancy and de-briefing and parents’ talks, we have helped teachers to arrange free play on their own. In response to the requirement that “half-day and whole-day kindergartens should arrange children to participate in free play lasting for no less than 30 and 50 minutes respectively every day” stipulated in the “Kindergarten Education Curriculum Guide” issued by the Education Bureau in early 2017, we seized the opportunity to launch the “Seed School Training Programme”. With different characteristics of schools in mind, we arranged demonstration, training and on-site consultancy and de-briefing to equip school teachers master the skills of arranging free play. We hope that the concept of “Seed Schools” will be expanded so that free play time can be extended from kindergartens to all pre-school settings, special schools and primary schools.\n28.2\tPlay in Community & Outreach\nChildren’s holistic growth is related to the community. If people in the communities accept children’s play, support play and even create play, children can grow more healthily. Hence, we began the trial of community play in 2012. In 2013, we launched a 3-year project titled “The Playbourhood” and implemented in different phases in Tin Shui Wai, Wong Tai Sin, Sau Mau Ping and Tseung Kwan O. \n28.2.1\tPlay in Neighborhood\nIn 2017, we introduced another 3-year project named “Playful Community League” which was implemented in Tai Po, Lai Chi Kok, Central Western District and Kwai Tsing. We aim to motivate the residents, community groups and organisations to join and collaborate their efforts to build up an atmosphere of free play and to establish a regular play space in the community parks so as to create a playful community for children.\nWe hope that there will be a child-led play space in every community and this concept can blossom in all 18 districts in Hong Kong so that every little neighbour can benefit from play.\n28.3\tIndoor Play\nFor children who want to play every day without worrying about the weather conditions, a quality indoor play space is what they need. To address the need, the HSBC PlayScope was officially opened in 2009 to be our first free play centre which is wholly designed and operated by Playright.\nAfter years of evolution and upgrading, more and more new and playful facilities and resources are provided at PlayScope. It now opens in a better operation mode and in all-weather which becomes the rare play space provided around the clock. Children from all communities are welcomed to join and grow happily and healthy in play.\nIn addition to its popularity among children and parents, PlayScope is also a good model of indoor free play space. It has attracted a lot of local and overseas organisations for visits and exchanges.\n28.4\tCommunity Outreach\nIn order to provide more play opportunities for little neighbours in the community, we have specially set up a community outreach service. We organise and promote quality and creative play in mobile basis for government departments, kindergartens, primary schools, social welfare organisations, commercial organisations, etc. Apart from providing a one-stop service, we also set up a good model for the community and promote a playful atmosphere.\n28.5\tPlay in Library\nStarting from 2001, Playright has been operating and managing the Toy Library in the Hong Kong Central Library to serve the citizens of Hong Kong. Since May 2021, we have adopted a brand new concept of “Enjoy Reading, Value Playing”.\nReading and playing are essential to all children. Reading comes alive when it is nested in play, and children can play within and beyond the stories. Through integrating reading and playing in the Toy Library, children can have fun – and lots of it!\nThe Toy Library is managed by a group of professional playworkers. All playworkers put children’s play needs as the core of their work, from the selection of picture books to the creation of play ideas, from the setting of seasonal themes to the play facilitation in general sessions and workshops.\n29\tHospital Play\nPlay is children’s basic need. Even when they are sick, their natural instinct does not change. Our Hospital Play, which commenced in 1994, is targeted at child patients. The service helps children to engage in play during their pathway of fighting an illness and being hospitalised, as well as to understand medical procedures, the environment and what is happening in their lives intellectually and psychologically. Apart from looking after children, we also support their families and partner with medical professionals to develop and promote hospital play and conduct research so as to strengthen holistic paediatric care.\nIn future decade, we aim to make every hospital with a Paediatric department include a hospital play service, thus letting play become an integral part of the growth of every sick child.\n29.1\tMedial Collaboration\nCurrently, Playright provides a regular honorary hospital play service at 6 public hospitals in 5 clusters. The hospitals receiving our service include the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital of the Hong Kong East cluster, the Caritas Medical Centre and the Princess Margaret Hospital of the Kowloon West cluster, the Tseung Kwan O Hospital of the Kowloon East cluster, the Hong Kong Children’s Hospital of the Kowloon Central Cluster, as well as the Prince of Wales Hospital of the New Territories East cluster.\nFor the benefit of sick children, our hospital play specialists are stationed at hospitals every weekday and work closely with the other professionals including doctors, nurses, specialist medical staff and ward staff. In view of different treatments and different illnesses, the hospital play specialists create partnerships with the medical team to design a tailor-made hospital play plan for the sick children. Apart from the daily hospital play, the hospital play specialists have also co-operated with hospitals in response to the outbreak of SARS, Human Swine flu and lead-in-drinking-water in housing estates with regard to calming children through routine medical procedures such as blood taking and/or being put in isolation.\n29.1.1\tPreparation Play\nWe prepare children psychologically for upcoming medical procedures and treatments in order to reduce their stress and anxiety, including chemotherapy, hemodialysis, CT scan, blood taking and many others.\n29.1.2\tDistraction Play\nWe help children cope with pain and anxiety during medical procedures by distracting them with interesting games and toys.\n29.1.3\tMedical Play\nThrough medical toys, we provide children with opportunities to learn some medical knowledge and express their feelings towards their illness.\n29.1.4\tTherapeutic Play\nWe provide tailor-made play services to children and teenagers who are suffering from behavioral problems, eating disorders or child abuse for helping them to build up a more healthy and happy life in the future.\n29.1.5\tDevelopmental Play\nWe provide appropriate play activities for children to have optimum psychobgical and psychosocial development during hospitalisation.\n29.1.6\tPlayright Channel\nPlayright introduced Hong Kong’s first-ever interactive hospital television channel in 2006. A lively monthly variety and game show broadcast in paediatric wards gives every child, even those confined to isolation wards, a chance to play and communicate with children in other wards. It is a valuable means for children to have fun through play and receive support from the community.\n29.1.7\tPatient Play Group\nThis play group, established by hospital play specialists, focuses on the voice of children. We encourage child patients to join the group to discover their individual potential, promote their self-values and developing strong mutual support for each other through different kinds of play activities.\n29.1.8\tLittle Star Project\nWe provide medical play workshops for preschool and primary school children, helping them understand more about hospitalisation and encouraging them to show their concern to hospital child patients.\n29.1.9\tVolunteer Play Service in Ward\nVolunteers are a valuable resource for the hospital play service. They not only help us to provide play service for hospitalised children, but advocate our mission and let the public know the importance of hospital play through their personal experiences\n29.1.10\tHospital Play Training & Workshops\nOur professional hospital play specialists have visited many more hospitals to offer their expert opinion to the healthcare professionals and volunteers in the design and provision of appropriate play as well as the special skills needed when playing with children under medical care. Besides, we will provide related talks and courses to different nursing schools and health professional associations by invitation.\n29.2\tChild-friendly Environment, Play & Leisure Activities\nThe ward environment can have a great influence on patients. Child patients are no exception. Hence, our service has always included creating a joyful hospital atmosphere. For example, we assist in developing a child-friendly ward and decorate for special occasions such as birthdays, festive seasons and celebrations for discharge.\nIn the playroom of the Princess Margaret Hospital and the Caritas Medical Centre, we have introduced toys and play that comply with the hygienic standards of the ward. The play and toys provided suit the needs of children of different ages and include board games, card games, and creative handicrafts. We even provide a tricycle in the ward and flour play at the specialist out-patients department.\nTaking hospitalised children outside is also one of our aims. From time to time, the hospital play specialists arrange different activities such as play days, baking-a-cookie classes, one-day trips to theme parks, life camps, and even adventure trips so that the children can enjoy leisure and be involved in a life appropriate to their age.\n29.3\tCommunity Partnerships\nThe interactive TV platform “Playright Channel” (https://www.youtube.com/user/playrighthk), launched in 2006. Is jointly organised by the hospital play specialists, the Community Health Resource Centre of the Princess Margaret Hospital and different NGOs. For child patients in the ordinary ward and isolation ward, the Channel regularly provides opportunities of coming into contact with the outside world.\nIn order to connect with child patients, we work closely with different patients groups such as the Kid Friend’s Club, the KID’s Dream Choir, the Little Life Warriors Society, the Children’s Kidney Fund, the Children’s Heart Foundation, etc. In addition, we also closely connect with different volunteer groups and corporate volunteers so as to increase resources and amass the power of caring for sick children.\n29.4\tTraining & Consultancy\nCollaboration with medical professionals is crucial in implementing hospital play. It is also important to train more people to be involved in hospital play. Over the years, we have continually organised seminars, workshops and training for the medical team of different hospitals. From 1995 onwards, we have joined hands with the HKU School of Professional And Continuing Education (HKU-SPACE) to organise a course on “Certificate in Theory and Practice of Hospital Play” to further the localisation of professional hospital play development.\nTo raise professional standards and update on trends in the medical field, our hospital play specialists often participate in local medical seminars and forums. From time to time, they also join international conferences or study professional courses so as to integrate new knowledge, experience and skills into their work.\nAs regards the exploration of hospital play by the medical field or enquires from cross-sectors, we are pleased to share our experiences or provide consultancy services.\n29.5\tPrimary Healthcare in a three-tier System\nWe believe in play and that children should be entitled to play even when they are sick. To actualise our beliefs, we commenced our hospital play service in 1994, gradually integrating ourselves into Hong Kong’s three-tier healthcare system—children’s hospitals, district hospitals and primary care.\nOver the years, we have strived to provide quality hospital play to child patients regardless of their ailment, catering for their cognitive, physical and emotional needs throughout different stages of illness, as well as those of their families.\n29.5.1\tHong Kong Children’s Hospital - since Dec. 2018\nProvide hospital play services in wards, specialist outpatient clinics and radiology departments for children with severe, complex, rare diseases, as well as those in need of multidisciplinary specialist treatment.\n29.5.2\tDistrict Hospital - since 1994\nServe children in five hospitals across four clusters, namely Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Tseung Kwan O Hospital, Caritas Medical Centre, Princess Margaret Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital.\n29.5.3\tPrimary Care - since 2005\nServe pre-school children in Kwai Tsing and Sham Shui Po Districts via the Little Star Project since 2005; In partnership with the Kwai Tsing and Sham Shui Po District Health Centres through the “Medical Play Experiential Box” initiative since November 2020.\n\nWith the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resurgence of asymptomatic cases, anyone is at risk of getting infected and hospitalised. In this period of uncertainty, we consider the “Medical Play Experiential Box” a playful and effective means to get children well-prepared ahead of time. To promote this concept among the healthcare sector, we held a launching ceremony on 21 November 2020.\nIt was our great honour to have Dr Lam Ching-choi, a specialist in Paediatrics and a non-official member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong, as our Honourable Guest of Honour to witness the birth of the “Medical Play Experiential Box”, along with representatives from the healthcare sector, social services sector and guests participating online. Other Guests of Honour included Dr Lee Tsz-leung, Hospital Chief Executive of Hong Kong Children’s Hospital; Dr Patrick Ip Pak-keung, President of The Hong Kong Paediatric Society; Ms Chan Yim-fan, Vice President of Hong Kong College of Paediatric Nursing; Ms Chan Yuk-ming, President of Hong Kong Paediatric Nurses Association; Dr Chow Chun-bong, Honourary Advisor of Playright Children’s Play Association; Ms Anita Ma Wai-man, Chairperson of the Executive Committee of Playright Children’s Play Association; and Dr Victor Koong Hing-yeung, Co-Vice Chairperson of the Executive Committee of Playright Children’s Play Association.\nWe were also deeply encouraged by the support of many doctors and nurses, who took time out of their fight against the pandemic to attend the ceremony online. Their positive response once again reaffirmed the value of the “Medical Play Experiential Box”.\n29.6\tAims for advocacy\nDeveloped by Playright’s Hospital Play Service team, the “Medical Play Experiential Box” consists of picture books, videos and playpacks which present correct information about illnesses and treatments in a child-friendly manner. Together, these measures represent a comprehensive package that assists children with psychological and cognitive preparation, reducing their anxiety and establishing a positive impression of hospitalisation. To promote the “Medical Play Experiential Box”, we have been actively seeking recognition from various sectors. We were privileged to have Dr Patrick Ip Pak-keung, President of The Hong Kong Paediatric Society, to feature in our video to offer his endorsement to our programme from his professional viewpoint as a doctor.\nWe also had the full support of Dr Maggie Koong May-kay, an early childhood education specialist, who made an appearance in another video to analyse the benefits of the “Medical Play Experiential Box” to children from child development perspectives. In the same episode, Dr Alan Wong Yan-ho and his wife Rendy Ng Ka-man gave highly relatable remarks on parents’ anxiety about children’s sickness.\nFundraising\n30\tFundraising Campaigns\n30.1\tPlayright Little Play Space Co-creation Box and Mini Model Online Exhibition 2022-2023\nThe Little Play Space Co-creation Box Campaign 2022-2023 is a fundraising project designed and organised by Playright Children’s Play Association. The Co-creation box promotes creative thinking and encourages the exploration of possibilities with loose parts between parents and children. Create your “Dream Playable Play Space in Neighbourhood” together in four steps - Experience, Explore, Express and Share!\n30.2\t#PlayChallenge @Urban Playground 2.0\nOver the last two years during the COVID-19 pandemic, working or studying at home was unavoidable. Feelings of boredom was very common among young people. And the stress of being stuck indoors challenged our well-being.\nPlayright is calling on all children and adults alike to go outdoors and play! We believe that through play, our community can come together to ignite joy, positivity, and perhaps even a bit of normalcy by having some outdoor fun.\nWhat’s New\n31\t2022 Oct 17 – Welcome our new Executive Director\nDear Friends of Playright,   \nFor more than 30 years, Playright Children’s Play Association (Playright) has been steadfast in our commitment to advocate for the value of play and seek societal commitment to meet the play needs of every child at the policy, planning and provision level.

The prolonged and increasing severity of the outbreak, stringent measures on social distancing for public health, suspension of school and child facilities are all an unexpected ordeal. Children experience loss of normality, loss of routine, decreased outdoor activities and disconnection with familiar faces. Sick children, children with special needs and those that are requiring hospitalisation face multiple barriers that restrict their day-to-day opportunities to play.\nAs an NGO advocating for the Child’s Right to Play in Hong Kong, we are concerned about the challenging circumstances arising from COVID-19. Opportunities for play is crucial to children’s well-being, mental and physical health. It has a significant therapeutic value in recovering a sense of normality and joy for children, as well as in alleviating harmful effects of stress and building resilience, especially in the situation of a crisis.\nChildren have a spontaneous urge to play, and they rely on adults to provide play opportunities for them. It is our duty to ensure children will be able to play in such a difficult situation.\nOur hearts go to the children in hospitals, especially when all our Hospital Play Specialists have no access to the children we serve in six public hospitals after the emergency response level was activated on 25 January, 2020 by the Hospital Authority. The Hospital Play Specialist team immediately developed age-appropriate playpacks, games, videos, play posters...... to connect, explain and “play” with the child patients through the support of medical professionals.\nThe team reached out to children suffering from COVID-19, as much as connect with patient support groups to share our play resources for children with chronic health condition in the community.\nAcknowledging that we are still operating with uncertainty about the future, the Hospital Play Specialist team continues to be open, imaginative and practical in redesigning the service, without losing sight of our missions and the needs of children. Nevertheless, we look beyond the The coronavirus pandemic has been an enormous challenge to everyone, especially children.

As an NGO advocating for the Child’s Right to Play in Hong Kong, we are concerned about the challenging circumstances arising from COVID-19. Opportunities for play is crucial to children’s well-being, mental and physical health. It has a significant therapeutic value in recovering a sense of normality and joy for children, as well as in alleviating harmful effects of stress and building resilience, especially in the situation of a crisis. Children have a spontaneous urge to play, and they rely on adults to provide play opportunities for them. It is our duty to ensure children will be able to play in such a difficult situation.\nProtecting a Child’s Right to Play in times of the Coronavirus Outbreak implication of Hospital Play Specialists not being allowed to support the child patients alongside the medical and nursing professionals, especially when the hospital play service is most needed. The value of play for child patients has been well documented, and similar services continue in other parts of the world where such services are established. It is time for Hong Kong to critically review and include hospital play as part of the essential provision for paediatric patients.\nPlayright had an opportunity to join hands with play experts around the world to develop resources “Play in Crisis: Support for Parents and Carers”, and Playright has translated it into Chinese. It has undoubtedly expanded our horizon as a play advocate in the four impact areas – Play Space, Play Provision, Play Time and Play Adults.\nHow will COVID-19 change the landscape of play advocacy in Hong Kong? As a non-official member of the Commission on Children, we also express concern whether our policy decisions are made with a child-perspective, including the anti-epidemic related measures. It should be time for us to review the impact on children and consider the aftermath of the pandemic.\nThe implication of COVID-19 is not at all evil. We perceive it as an opportunity to reimagine a “New Normality” for children’s play, for Playright, Hong Kong and for the world. Life will not be the same, but we can work together to make it better for children. Playright has committed to inspire and contribute, making Hong Kong a “Playful City” where the play need of All children can be realised with the support of adults, playtime, play space and play policy. Yes, we need responsive adults who understand the need for play, supportive communities where playing is celebrated, and policies that are sensitive to children’s play needs and put children’s well-being as the priority!\n32.1\tA New Challenge\nSome physical conditions of hospitalised children prevent them from enjoying playpacks. So, how should we respond to their play needs, considering multiple conditions and demands? In response, our hospital play specialists kicked-off a video production, creating a new version of our Hospital Play Channel.\nOur Hospital Play Channel was introduced in 2005, to conduct interactive play with child patients in isolation rooms via real-time video platforms. In the face of the latest pandemic, our hospital play specialists utilised this valuable experience to create the 2020 version of the Hospital Play Channel, where storytelling, music sharing, as well as interactive play came alive.\nDuring the Lunar New Year, our hospital play specialists used the video channel to attend to the children’s anticipation of the festival in various ways, including the “Twelve Zodiac Stories” about the origin of the Chinese zodiacs and “New Spring Little Rat” about making traditional New Year decoration (“Fai chuns”), thereby creating a festive atmosphere for the hospitalised children.\nShifting from serving children from the hospital bedside to conducting play within a camera frame was initially a huge challenge for our hospital play specialists as beginners at videographing. From storywriting, preparatory work, video shooting, to post-production, we took everything on ourselves. Simple as it seems, every story was carefully developed from research in books or the Internet and enriched through creativity, in the hope that children would enjoy the final product, along with acquiring accurate information. During production, our hospital play specialists transformed into directors,set designers, boom operators, cameramen, editors, etc., undergoing processes of attempts, exploration, revision and re-dos in aspects of camera angles, equipment operation and use of editing software. As you can imagine, every dialogue and camera shot in each video clip are the fruits of painstaking yet heartfelt labour.\nChildren in the hospital are the core existence of our hospital play specialists. Therefore, we desire to return back to the wards as soon as possible, demonstrating procedure play in person, listening to them and sharing their worries. Of course, if Hong Kong’s hospitals incorporated hospital play into the regular services in paediatric wards and made our hospital play specialists as formal members of the ward team, we would still be able to work on the frontline, contributing to the child patients’ well-being, regardless of any raging pandemic or not!\n33\tIntervention Research on Children’s Free Play: Parents’ Perspectives 2021\n33.1\tExecutive Summary\nThis study was undertaken in Hong Kong, in which the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on people from all walks of life was evident. Various preventive measures were enforced, including the closure of many outdoor playgrounds and the suspension of face-to-face contact in schools. These preventive measures impacted children because of the restrictions on their use of public facilities for leisure activities.\nPlayright has always promoted free play in Hong Kong and had considerable concerns about the impact of the pandemic on children’s play. In this regard, Playright developed a free play protocol that was implemented either in self-organised programmes or in partnership with some kindergartens. Against this backdrop, this study examined the evidence-based outcomes of the protocol.\n33.2\tResearch Objectives\nThe study aimed to examine parents’ perceptions of free play, parents’ engagement with their child in free play, and the possible influences of free play on parents’ mental health and parent-child relationships. Specifically, this study aimed to address research areas, including\n1)\tParents’ perceptions of free play;\n2)\tParents’ engagement in free play with their children;\n3)\tBarriers and difficulties faced by parents in engaging in free play with their children;\n4)\tThe outcomes of free play, specifically on parent-child relationships and parents’ mental health.\n33.3\tMethodology\nPart A of the study investigated the effectiveness of the PLAYBAG intervention protocol in three kindergartens. Target participants were parents who participated in the PLAYBAG programme in these three kindergartens. A mixed-methods approach was adopted to collect quantitative pre- and post-intervention data by questionnaires capturing parents’ perceptions of free play, their engagement with their children in free play, their mental health and their relationship with their children. Parents participated in focus group interviews to inform understanding of their engagement in free play with their children. Thematic analysis was employed to analyse the data from the focus group interviews.\nPart B comprised a cross-sectional and quantitative investigation of parents’ perceptions of free play, their participation in free play with their children and their relationships with their children. Target respondents were parents involved in the ‘Playright Home Play Box’ and ‘Medical Play Experiential Box’ activities organised by Playright between April 2020 and May 2021.\n33.4\tFindings\nPart A confirmed the evidence-based effectiveness of the PLAYBAG intervention protocol in terms of enhancing parents’ perceptions of free play, fostering positive parent-child relationships, and promoting parents’ mental health. In addition, more than 80% of parents agreed that their child spent more time on PLAYBAG and other free play activities at home and that they had increased confidence engaging in free play activities with their child.\nRegarding the intersection of parents’ perceptions of play and socio-demographic background, Part B found that mothers were more inclined to endorse play freedom than fathers. Fathers embraced play safety more than mothers. Compared to parents with a tertiary or university education, parents with senior high school or below education were more inclined to endorse parental rules, play safety, gender stereotyping, and the importance of structured play and were less inclined to support imaginative play. In terms of play freedom, no significant difference was evident between parents with different levels of education. Parents in full-time employment were less inclined to support parental rules in play. Compared with parents of primary school-aged children, parents of children in kindergarten were less focused on parental rules when engaging in free play with their children. Regarding living space, parents living in confined accommodations were much concerned about safety problems when engaging in free play with their children.\nThis study also examined the intersection of parents’ perceptions of play and parent-child relationships. Closer parent-child interaction and more positive parent-child relationships as a whole were evident among parents who endorsed play freedom and imaginative play. More conflict in parent-child relationships was observed when parents emphasised play safety and gender stereotyping in children’s play. Investigation of the relationship between parental perceptions of play and the average time spent in free play revealed that parents who endorsed play freedom, imaginative play and children’s choices allowed their children to spend more time on free play.\nThis study found that children spent more time in free play with their mother than their father. It identified parents’ long working hours, children’s rest schedules, and limited indoor space as the three most important barriers impacting parents’ engagement in free play with their children. Parents considered female children’s rest schedules the most influential factor affecting free play. Parents of primary school-age children considered the amount of homework as the most influential factor in free play. Parents who emphasised play safety were more likely to consider limited indoor space and difficulty balancing responsibilities as factors influencing their engagement in free play with their children. Moreover, parents who embraced play safety were more inclined to impose rules and regulations on their children in free play. This posed a dilemma for parents in balancing the roles of discipline enforcer and playmate.\nThe focus group interviews provided a fruitful insight into understanding parents’ participation in free play with their children. Four essential elements were identified that facilitated meaningful interaction between parents and children in free play: 1) an egalitarian and non-judgmental attitude, 2) the quality of encounters with children in free play, 3) discoveries about their children, and 4) sustaining new meanings of their children’s identity.\n33.5\tRecommendations\nThe results of this study generated the following recommendations:\n1)\tEnhancement of the PLAYBAG intervention protocol to address the specific needs of parents from different socio-economic backgrounds. For instance, parents’ sessions for fathers, parents with full-time employment, parents with children from different age groups etc. Contents of parents’ sessions could provide more solutions to tackle the dilemmas faced by parents when engaging in free play with their children. More scenarios regarding possible ways to use the unstructured play materials in free play could be added in the parents’ sessions.\n2)\tParental education on free play should be widely implemented in kindergartens and schools through collaboration among different stakeholders in the community, echoing a recent proposal, “Curriculum Framework on Parent Education (Kindergarten)” published by the Education Bureau. Parental education on children’s free play might include principles and benefits of free play, effective ways to engage children in free play, creating quality free play time in families, and co-parenting perspective of engaging fathers and mothers in free play.\n3)\tPromotion of free play to the general public, in particular, to generate an understanding of the importance of free play, and positive outcomes regarding the enhancement of mental health and parent-child relationships, should be emphasised in community education programmes. The pandemic seriously affected parents’ and children’s mental health and well-being, and free play in the home and school environment helped relieve stress and anxiety and enhance family bonding.\n4. The barriers to children’s engagement in free play should be removed. Home-school collaboration needs to be strengthened to enhance parents’ and children’s creativity, participation, and collaboration in free play activities. Teachers’ training regarding free play implementation in school settings are recommended. Policies to streamline the amount of homework given to children and the development of a child-friendly free play school environment are advocated.\n5. Creating an innovative child-friendly free play environment should be promoted through collaboration between different stakeholders in the community. Apart from improving the designated playgrounds provided by Housing Authority and Leisure and Cultural Services Department, different community stakeholders could work together to create various doorstep, indoor or outdoor play space for children and their parents to have free play in safe environment.\n6. Last but not least, consideration should be given to empowering children’s voices to cocreate a free play environment. Different models or tools for children’s participation should be adopted to fit various needs of children. Moreover, trainings are also required for the adults to listen, collect and respect children’s voices in regard to those child-related issues.\n34\tResearch 2014 on the effectiveness of therapeutic play in minimising anxiety and negative emotions of hospitalised children\n34.1\tProject Summary\nObjective: To test the effectiveness of a therapeutic play intervention in minimising the anxiety levels and negative emotions of hospitalised Hong Kong Chinese children.\nMethods: A non-equivalent control group pretest–posttest, between subjects design was conducted in the two largest acute-care public hospitals in Hong Kong. Chinese children (3-12 years of age; n = 304) admitted for treatment in these two hospitals were invited to participate in the study. Of the 304 subjects, 154 received the therapeutic play intervention and 150 received usual care.\nResults: Children who received the therapeutic play intervention reported less negative emotional behaviour and lower levels of anxiety compared to those who received usual care only during hospitalisation.\nConclusion: The study provides empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of therapeutic play interventions in minimising the anxiety and negative emotions of hospitalised children.\nPractice implications: The findings heighten the awareness of the importance of integrating therapeutic play as an essential component of holistic and high-quality care to ease the psychological burden of hospitalised children. It is crucial to have more hospital play specialists to facilitate the integration of therapeutic play into routine care for hospitalised children.\n34.2\tIntroduction\nHospitalisation can be a stressful and threatening experience for everyone, especially for children [1]. The physiological and psychological health needs of children are typically different from those of adults. Children are more vulnerable to the stress of hospitalisation because of their cognitive limitations, lack of self-control, dependence on others, and limited experience and knowledge of the healthcare system [2]. A lack of understanding about the upcoming procedures, unfamiliarity with the hospital environment, and failure to understand the reasons for hospitalisation can add to their anxiety, fear, anger, uncertainty, and feelings of helplessness. Among these negative responses, anxiety is the most commonly reported. Excessive anxiety can be detrimental to children’s physical and psychological health. Anxiety also hinders children’s ability to cope with medical treatment, and encourages negative and uncooperative behaviour toward healthcare. The link between anxiety and negative outcomes suggests that reducing children’s anxiety during periods of hospitalisation could promote better recovery.\nPlay has been widely used in many Western countries to alleviate the stress experienced by paediatric patients and their families during hospitalisation. Erikson and Piaget observed that play is essential for children’s normal growth and development, as it provides an expression of their understanding about the world and an opportunity for them to develop mastery of self and the environment. Indeed, play has long been recognised as a vital element of psychological interventions to help children withstand the stress of hospitalisation.\nFlorence Erickson, a pioneer in the study of play for hospitalised children, emphasised that play is an integral part of children’s lives. Erickson conducted a study to explore the reactions of children to hospital experience and confirmed that children who were given an opportunity to play with clinical equipment were better able to express their feelings about their hospital experiences. She demonstrated the benefits of using play interviews and dolls to prepare hospitalised children for intrusive medical procedures.\n34.3\tPlay Therapy and Therapeutic Play\nAccording to psychoanalytic theory, play therapy is part of child psychiatry and is similar in\nnature to psychotherapy for adults. Erikson described how play therapy benefited children who had experienced trauma or who had behavioural disorders. Over the past decades, play therapy has been widely used by psychotherapists to help children work through their problems during psychotherapy.\nTherapeutic play, in contrast, is a set of structured activities appropriately designed for children’s levels of psychosocial and cognitive development and health-related issues to psychologically prepare them for hospitalisation. The past decade has seen an increase in the use of therapeutic play interventions to help children cope with the stress of hospitalisation. Regrettably, the majority of studies that have studied activities for hospitalised children have been in the form of case studies based on theories and clinical observations. There is a lack of empirical evidence to accurately determine the clinical effectiveness of the therapeutic play. The results of a randomised controlled trial to examine the effects of a therapeutic play intervention on the outcomes of children undergoing day surgery showed that those who received the intervention reported lower state anxiety scores and exhibited fewer instances of negative emotional behaviour in pre- and postoperative periods. Nevertheless, the implications of this study were limited because the children only received minor elective surgeries and did not stay in hospital overnight. Therefore, more empirical evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of therapeutic play in reducing the anxiety levels and negative emotions of hospitalised children. \nIt is well documented that Hong Kong Chinese people are influenced by the philosophy of Confucianism, which emphasises balance and harmony achieved through the concepts of chung and yung in everyday life. Under the influence of this philosophy, disease is regarded as arising from ‘bad spirits’, and it is believed that exercise will only aggravate the disease and violate the rule of harmony. In this cultural context, hospitalised children are often advised by their parents or even healthcare professionals to take more rest and not to engage in any energy-consuming activities, including play activities. Furthermore, as many Chinese parents and some healthcare staff traditionally view play as less important than physiological care or medical treatment, it is not clear whether therapeutic play is an appropriate and feasible psychological intervention for hospitalised children in the Hong Kong Chinese context. Given these issues, this study aimed to test the effectiveness of a therapeutic play intervention in minimising the anxiety and negative emotions of hospitalised Hong Kong Chinese children. Specifically, the focus was on assessing the potential of implementing the therapeutic play intervention for hospitalised children in Hong Kong clinical settings.\n34.4\tTheoretical framework\nThis study was guided by Lazarus and Folkman’s [13] theory of cognitive appraisal, stress and coping, which is one of the most commonly applied theoretical perspectives on how people cope with stress. This transactional model is also the most frequently applied model in research on children [2, 12, 14]. According to Lazarus and Folkman [13], stress is defined as a dynamic ongoing relationship between a person and his or her environment, and cognitive appraisal is the process by which an individual evaluates or judges the meaning of a potentially stressful event and its significance to his or her well-being. \nIt is well documented that hospitalisation can be a highly stressful and anxiety-provoking experience for children and can have profound effects on them. Lazarus and Folkman postulated that individuals’ evaluations are influenced by their perceptions of control over a potential threat. Previous studies have shown that a lack of control over the physical setting of the hospital and upcoming medical procedures is a major source of stress, which may cause considerable anxiety for hospitalised children. We reasoned that if children believe they have adequate control over a potential threat, they will experience less anxiety and report fewer negative emotions. Therefore, a primary goal of the therapeutic play intervention was to assist children in regaining a sense of self-control. We anticipated that conducting the intervention in the hospital would increase children’s familiarity with the hospital environment and thereby enhance their sense of personal control. We also surmised that through participating in play activities, children would develop their interpersonal and communication skills, self-care and social and creative abilities. Children were not only encouraged to have fun, but were also taught to desensitise to potentially stressful situations and to instil a sense of control over the situation in which they were involved. The intervention allowed the children to practise medical or nursing routines through play and interact with the environment in an active and non-threatening rather than passive way. \n34.5\tMethods \n34.5.1\tDesign and sample \nTo examine the effects of the therapeutic play intervention, we used a non-equivalent control group pretest–posttest, between-subjects design. The study was carried out in the two largest acute-care public hospitals in Hong Kong, with one hospital assigned as the “control” and the other as the “experimental” hospital. The two hospitals have similar paediatric specialities, settings, and medical and nursing care. Chinese children admitted for treatment in these two acute public hospitals and who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the study. The inclusion criteria for eligible children were (1) aged between 3 and 12 years, (2) able to speak Cantonese, and (3) required to stay in hospital for at least three consecutive days. Children with cognitive and learning difficulties identified from their medical records were excluded. \nThe sample size was calculated to ensure sufficient power to detect differences between the groups. With reference to the previous study that examined the effects of therapeutic play intervention on the outcomes of children undergoing day surgery, we predicted a medium effect size for the differences between the two groups. To predict this effect size at a 5% significance level (p < 0.05) and power of 0.80, we calculated that 64 subjects would be required in each group. We allowed for a potential attrition rate of 15%, which is common in experimental designs. Accordingly, 11 additional participants per group were needed to cover the attrition, giving a total sample size of 150. However, according to Piaget, children aged between 3-7 and 8-12 are at the preoperational and concrete operational stages of development, respectively. Because children’s cognitive development is linked to their age, different methods of assessment were used for the two age groups. Therefore, the data analyses were performed separately for the two age groups, 3-7 and 8-12 years. Hence, we aimed to recruit at least 300 (150 in each age group) subjects in this study. \n34.6\tIntervention \nThe control group participants received usual medical and nursing care, while the experimental group participants received around 30 minutes of therapeutic play intervention, which hospital play specialists conducted on each weekday. The content of the therapeutic play included a variety of structured and non-structured activities. The hospital play specialists selected suitable activities in accordance with the children’s sex, age, ability, type of illness, and general condition. The children were also given a choice of play activities. The hospital play specialist documented the timing, duration, and nature of play for each child in a log book. Some examples of the therapeutic play intervention are provided in Table 1. \n34.7\tMeasures\n34.7.1\tDemographic data sheet \nA demographic data sheet constructed for this study was used to record the children’s demographic and clinical characteristics, including their age, gender, diagnosis, and number of hospital admissions.\n34.7.2\tAnxiety levels of children aged between 3 and 7 years 10 \nThe visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess children’s anxiety levels. The VAS consists of a 10 cm horizontal line on a piece of paper, with different facial expressions supplemented by the words ‘not worried’ at one end and ‘very worried’ at the other. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety. Children aged between 5 and 7 used a movable indicator to show their levels of anxiety. However, as children aged 3-4 might have limited verbal expression and cognitive capacities and could be confused by the scale, this age group was assessed by asking the parents to rate their child’s anxiety level. The VAS is one of the most widely used measurement tools because it is easy to administer, simple for children to understand, and is a valid method for measuring subjective feelings [17]. One of the biggest advantages of using the VAS is that it is not affected by the limited test-taking ability of younger children. Previous studies have found the VAS to be a reliable, valid, and sensitive measure of individual subjective feelings. \n34.7.3\tAnxiety levels of children aged between 8 and 12 years \nThe anxiety levels of children in this age group were measured using the short form of the Chinese version of the State Anxiety Scale for Children (CSAS-C). The short form of the CSAS-C consists of 10 items scored from 1 to 3, with total possible scores ranging from 10 to 30. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety. The psychometric properties of the short form of the CSAS-C have been empirically tested [20] and show adequate internal consistency reliability, good concurrent validity, and excellent construct validity. The results of a confirmatory factor analysis added further evidence of the construct validity of the short form of the CSAS-C.\n34.8\tChildren’s Emotional Manifestation Scale (CEMS) \nThe emotional responses of the hospitalised children were documented using the CEMS. The CEMS score is obtained by reviewing the descriptions of behaviour in each category and selecting the number that most closely represents the child’s observed behaviour. Each category is scored from 1 to 5, with summed scores between 5 and 25. Higher scores indicate more negative emotional behaviour. The psychometric properties of the CEMS have been empirically tested and show adequate internal consistency reliability, good inter-rater reliability, and excellent construct validity. \n34.8.1\tProcess evaluation \nTo assess the implementation potential of the therapeutic play intervention, a short one-to-one semi-structured interview was conducted with five children aged between 8 and 12 and with the parents of five children aged between 3 and 12, randomly selected from the experimental group. Children and parents were interviewed separately. They were asked to express their views on the acceptability and suitability of the therapeutic play intervention. In addition, to examine whether it is feasible to implement the therapeutic play intervention in clinical settings and whether it is acceptable to healthcare providers, five nurses working in the paediatric units delivering the therapeutic play intervention were randomly invited for a short interview at the end of the study. All of the interviews were conducted by a full-time research assistant with considerable experience of conducting qualitative interviews. The interviews were taped-recorded.\n34.9\tData collection procedures\nApproval for the study was obtained from the hospital ethics committees. Written consent was obtained from the parents after they were told the purpose of the study. The children and their parents were informed that they had the right to withdraw from the study at any time and were assured of the confidentiality of their data.\nAfter signing the consent form, a research assistant collected the demographic data from the parents and from the children’s medical records. The children’s baseline anxiety levels were also assessed and documented. For the experimental group, the therapeutic play intervention started after the baseline data had been collected. A research assistant observed the emotional behaviour of each child for two consecutive days (4 hours consecutively per day). At the end of the two days’ observation, a research assistant documented the child’s overall emotional behaviour using the CEMS. The child’s anxiety levels were reassessed and documented. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with selected children and their parents. Once the data collection for all participants was completed, a short interview was conducted with selected nurses working in the paediatric units where the therapeutic play intervention was implemented.\n34.10\tData analysis \nThe Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS: Version 19; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows was used for the data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate the means, standard deviations, and ranges of the scores on the various scales. The homogeneity of the experimental and control groups was assessed using inferential statistics (independent t-test and x2). The interrelationships among the scores on the different scales and the demographic variables were investigated using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Differences in the mean scores on the CEMS and the children’s anxiety levels between the two intervention groups were assessed by an independent t-test and mixed between-within subjects ANOVA, respectively. Multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the effects of participants’ demographic and clinical characteristics on the outcome measures.\nContent analysis was adopted to analyse the semi-structured interviews. According to Weber (1990), it is one of the most objective and systematic approaches used for qualitative data analysis. With reference to the study protocol, the recordings were fully transcribed verbatim immediately after the interviews. Two research students who were not involved in data collection helped to identify different themes by examining the transcriptions line by line. All these identified themes would be further summarised as codes according to their similarities and differences. Any dialogue relevant to the codes was translated into English for reporting. The research team members resolved disagreements of the analysis during their meetings. \n34.11\tResults\nA total of 393 patients were recruited from November 2012 to October 2013. However, 89 questionnaires were found to be largely incomplete as a result of unanticipated early discharge or intra-hospital transfer. Therefore, 304 questionnaires from a total eligible pool of 393 patients were used for the analysis. Of the 304 patients, 154 received the therapeutic play intervention and 150 received usual care.\n34.11.1\tDemographic characteristics of the participants \n34.11.2\tGender distribution \nThe experimental and control groups in the two age groups contained similar numbers of boys and girls. The demographic and baseline anxiety scores for the experimental and control groups for the 3 to 7 and 8 to 12 year-old age groups are further summarised in Table 2. The results show that the experimental and control groups in the two age groups were similar with respect to the children’s ages, sex, diagnoses, number of hospital admissions, and baseline anxiety scores, suggesting a high level of comparability of variance between the experimental and control groups. \n34.12\tFactors contributing to children’s negative emotions and anxiety\nThe relationships among the scores on the different scales and the demographic variables were investigated. With reference to Cohen, correlation coefficients of 0.10 to 0.29, 0.30 to 0.49, and 0.50 to 1.0 were interpreted as small, medium, and large, respectively. The results indicated that there were statistically significant high positive correlations between the anxiety and CEMS scores of children aged 3-7 (r = .62, n = 182, p = .01) and 8-12 (r =.70, n = 122, p = .01). Furthermore, small negative correlations were found between the time of hospital admission and anxiety scores for children aged 3-7 (r = 0.26, n = 182, p < .01) and 8-12 (r 0.28, n = 122, p < .01). The results of the multiple regression analyses indicated that demographic and clinical factors, including the children’s age and gender, diagnosis and time of hospital admission, did not make a statistically significant contribution to the prediction of anxiety and CEMS scores. \n34.13\tNegative emotions of children between the experimental and control groups \nAn independent t-test showed statistically significant differences between the mean CEMS scores of children aged 3-7 in the experimental (M = 9.4, S.D. =1.9) and control groups [M = 18 \n\n \n \n12.6, S.D. =3.4; t (180) = 7.3, p < .001], and of children aged 8-12 in the experimental (M = 10.8, S.D. = 2.7) and control groups [M = 13.7, S.D. = 3.8; t (120) = 8.1, p < .001]. Children who received the therapeutic play intervention reported less negative emotional behaviour during hospitalisation. \n34.14\tAnxiety level of children between the experimental and control groups \nThe mean anxiety levels of children aged 3-7 in the experimental and control groups are illustrated in Figure 7. As shown in the figure, the mean anxiety levels of children in the experimental and control groups were more or less the same at T1. However, there was a substantial decline [2.8 points] in the mean anxiety level in the experimental group at T2, whereas the mean anxiety level of control group only slightly decreased by 0.6 points at T2.\n34.15\tQualitative interview results \n34.15.1\tChildren and their parents’ perceptions of the play intervention \nWhen the children were asked to comment on their perceptions of receiving the therapeutic play intervention in the hospital, many stated that it helped them know more about medical procedures. With such an understanding, the children said they no longer felt anxious and stressed before their medical procedures. Some examples of the children’s responses are given below. \n“I was not going to worry about venipuncture after the therapeutic play intervention. The play specialist explained the procedures to me during the intervention. I don’t get scared of syringes anymore. They can be fun, like a toy. I also made a syringe doll by myself with the help of the play specialist.” \nThe parents shared similar thoughts. Many of them stated that their children became much more settled after the intervention and some said that their children were much more courageous about having medical procedures. Some examples of their responses are given below. \n“My son became much more settled after the therapeutic play intervention. He felt much happier after playing with the play specialist.” \n“I’ve never seen my son so brave when facing medical procedures. I would like to thank the play specialist for her therapeutic play intervention.” \nBoth the children and their parents reported that their impressions of the hospital changed after the intervention. Before the intervention, many of them perceived that healthcare professionals, particularly doctors and nurses, were apathetic and not sensitive enough to patients’ psychological needs. As such, they did not feel able to ask questions during the medical procedure or the consultation. After the intervention, most of them changed their mind and said they felt the hospital cared about their psychological needs. They generally thought that the hospital play specialists were members of the hospital staff, and their good performance had a direct positive effect on the image of all healthcare professionals, thus helping to build trusting relationships between the medical staff and patients. Some examples of their responses are given below.\n“I am not afraid to see doctors now. I am able to express my feelings and ask them questions. I was startled by my last experience in another hospital because they (healthcare professionals) didn’t care what I thought. However, I wasn’t stressed this time because they (the play specialists) have been helping me to cope with the pain (caused by medical procedures).” \n“It is awesome to have emotional support from the play specialist. I feel that I am respected and cared for by the hospital.” \n34.16\tSuitability of the therapeutic play intervention \nMany of the children and their parents said they were happy to receive the therapeutic play intervention because the activities were fun and interesting. Some examples of their responses are given below.\n“I like having the therapeutic play intervention – it’s fun. I no longer feel bored and lonely after such an intervention.’\n‘It (the therapeutic play intervention) is a wonderful service for my child; I am satisfied with the activities and games because they are fun and interesting.” \nSome parents also said the teaching methods were interactive, which helped draw children’s attention to the information about standard medical procedures, which are commonly regarded as boring topics. An example of their responses is given below. \n“My son had more medical knowledge after the therapeutic play.” \nSome parents mentioned that the therapeutic play intervention provided an opportunity for their children to socialise with others. During the intervention, they could make friends with other children on the ward so that they felt less lonely. An example of their responses is given below. \n“Since the therapeutic play intervention, my daughter does not mind having to stay longer in the hospital. She made friends with the girl who was next to her and the play specialist during the intervention.” \n34.17\tNurses’ perceptions of the play intervention \nMany nurses reported that the psychological needs of hospitalised children were fulfilled after receiving hospital play intervention. \n“It is easily observed that those children who received therapeutic play intervention exhibited fewer negative emotions, such as crying during hospitalisation. Most importantly, I found that children were easily calmed down and became more cooperative during medical procedures. It’s really unbelievable!”\nNotwithstanding the fact that many nurses found hospital play intervention was effective in reducing anxiety and negative emotions for hospitalised children, some of them thought they couldn’t implement it because of the tight schedule. They hoped that more resources could be allocated by the government in future to sustain this intervention. \n“I do support having therapeutic play intervention within the hospital as it can improve the quality of care delivery and create a positive image of the hospital. Given that our workload is hefty, an insufficient workforce is a major obstacle to implementing therapeutic play in the hospital. It would be perfect if more resources, particularly staffing, can be allocated to the pediatric units for such activity.” \n34.18\tDiscussion \nThe findings of this study suggest that the Hong Kong Chinese children experienced considerable anxiety on admission to hospital. The results are consistent with previous studies that found that hospitalised children experienced different degrees of sadness, unhappiness and worry. In comparison with previous studies that have used the same scale to measure the anxiety of Hong Kong Chinese children of a similar age, the anxiety scores of children on admission to hospital in this study were similar to those of children immediately before undergoing surgery, but higher than those of school children in the pre-academic examination period. The results also showed a high positive correlation between the CSAS-C and CEMS. The findings concur with those of a previous study, in which children with high anxiety levels in the immediate pre-operative period had more negative emotional responses during the procedure for anaesthesia induction. The findings provide further evidence that anxiety hinders children’s ability to cope with hospitalisation and medical treatment, and increases negative and uncooperative behaviour toward healthcare. \nThere is an assumption that the number of hospital admissions a child experiences strongly affects his or her anxiety levels and emotional responses. Nevertheless, the multiple regression analysis results did not find statistically significant effects for the number of hospital admissions on children’s outcomes in this study. The findings suggest that hospitalisation is a stressful and threatening experience for children, regardless of whether they have had previous hospital admission experience. \nThe overall results support the effectiveness of therapeutic play in minimising the anxiety levels and negative emotions of Hong Kong Chinese children who have been hospitalised. Indeed, providing therapeutic play for children during hospitalisation has particular advantages because illness and its accompanying stress and physical restriction interrupt natural play and socialisation, which are essential for children’s normal growth and development. Most importantly, involvement in play activities during hospitalisation can improve children’s coping skills and decrease their stress, eventually leading to better psychosocial adjustment to their illness and hospitalisation. \n34.18.1\tImplementation potential of therapeutic play in clinical settings \nAlthough the overall results provide evidence that the therapeutic play intervention was effective in minimising children’s anxiety and negative emotions during hospitalisation, it is crucial to ensure that the intervention can be implemented in clinical practice. To ensure the children were able to engage in play activities, the time of implementation was flexible and the sessions were repeated at different times of the day. Participants were invited to join the play activities when they were not occupied by any medical treatments or physiological care. Therefore, it would be feasible for the healthcare system to consider incorporating therapeutic play as a routine psychological preparation for children undergoing hospitalisation. \nMost of the interviewed children reported that the therapeutic play intervention helped relieve their anxiety because they better understand their illness and the medical procedures. Most of the children were pleased to know that most of the medical or nursing procedures would not cause them any pain and would be well controlled. Most importantly, the children enjoyed the therapeutic play in the hospital and found the activities fun and interesting. \nAlthough Chinese parents have traditionally viewed play as less critical for hospitalised children than physiological care or medical treatment, most of the parents in the experimental group appreciated the availability of play activities within the hospital. Indeed, a previous study conducted in Hong Kong showed that parents were reassured by watching their children participate in play activities and interact with children. \nAll of the nurses in the interview commented that the therapeutic play effectively reduced the children’s negative emotions during hospitalisation, which gave them time to calm the children down and meant that the medical or nursing procedures could be administered more smoothly. Most of them agreed that therapeutic play should be implemented within the hospital. Most importantly, nurses believe that it creates a more positive image of the hospital and staff as a result of implementing therapeutic play interventions for hospitalised children. Nevertheless, they expressed strong concern about the extra manpower required, which needs more support from the hospital organisation. However, the shortage of nurses in Hong Kong hospitals is not just a local but a global problem. Although most nurses believe that therapeutic play can be an effective intervention for promoting the psychological well-being of hospitalised children, it is not feasible for them to spend half an hour providing play activities for each child.\nNevertheless, supporting the children to adapt to life in the hospital and face the stress of treatments is crucial. It is essential to have Hospital Play Service in paediatric wards. Using hospital play specialists (HPS) to implement therapeutic play may be one of the best solutions to the shortage of nurses. Most hospitals in Australia, the United States, and other Western countries employ HPS, who play an important role in promoting psychological care for hospitalised children through the provision of play activities. Although it may require some extra resources in the short term, it would certainly enhance hospitals’ capacity to promote better health in the long run. Indeed, it only takes about half an hour a day to provide a creative recreational and psychosocial intervention to make a child’s hospitalisation less difficult. Clearly, it would be economically feasible for the healthcare system to consider and implement this intervention as a routine practice for hospitalised children.\n34.19\tLimitations \nThere are some limitations of this study. First, although a randomised controlled trial is the most powerful approach for testing cause-and-effect relationships between independent and dependent variables, we could not randomise individual patients within a paediatric unit in a hospital because there was a possibility of contamination between different treatment groups within the setting, and because some children and their parents might have been concerned if they were aware that they were experiencing a different form of intervention. Therefore, a non-equivalent control group design was used. Second, the use of convenience sampling and therapeutic play intervention was only implemented in one setting, thus limiting the generalisability of the results. Third, this study only observed children’s anxiety levels and emotional responses on two consecutive days, which may not have been long enough to fully assess hospitalisation’s effect on the children’s psychological well-being. Nevertheless, as short-stay hospitalisation is recommended in today’s healthcare policy, many hospitalised children will be discharged home after 1 to 3 days.\n34.20\tPractice implications \nThe findings of the study generate new knowledge and evidence about therapeutic play with major clinical implications. The results emphasise the importance of integrating therapeutic play as an essential component of holistic and high-quality care to ease the psychological burden of hospitalised children. It also promotes the awareness in healthcare professionals and parents that play is a very important part of children’s life, and that they need play even when they are ill. Indeed, play is instinctive, voluntary, and spontaneous; children play just as birds fly and fish swim. We believe the therapeutic play intervention can be applied to all children regardless of their cultural backgrounds or settings. Given the importance of play to children’s psychological health, it is recommended that the hospital authority should advocate the importance of play for hospitalised children by providing more resources to establish more space and facilitates for children to play. Most importantly, it is crucial to employ hospital play specialists to facilitate the integration of therapeutic play into routine care for hospitalised children. \n34.21\tConclusion\nNotwithstanding the potential limitations, this study has addressed a gap in the literature by examining the effects of a therapeutic play intervention on the outcomes of hospitalised children. The most important contribution of this study is the empirical evidence it provides to support the effectiveness of therapeutic play intervention in minimising the anxiety and negative emotions of hospitalised children.\n"}]}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "write a database from scratch in c and explain each line in detailsSure! Here is an example of how you might write a simple database from scratch in C.

This constant is used to specify the maximum number of records that the database can hold.Copy codetypedef struct {\n  char name[50];\n  int age;\n} Record;\nfinish the last answerThis line defines a struct type named Record that represents a single record in the database. A struct is a composite data type that consists of a collection of variables of different types. In this case, the Record struct has two fields: name, which is an array of characters (a string), and age, which is an integer. The typedef keyword allows us to define a new type name, Record, that can be used to declare variables of this type.Copy codeRecord database[MAX_RECORDS];\nThis line declares an array of Record structs named database, with a maximum capacity of MAX_RECORDS records. This array will store the records in the database.Copy codeint num_records = 0;\nThis line declares a variable named num_records of type int and initializes it to 0. This variable is used to keep track of the number of records currently stored in the database.Copy codevoid add_record(char* name, int age) {\n  // Check if the database is full.\n  if (num_records == MAX_RECORDS) {\n    printf(\"Error: database is full.\\n\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Add the record to the database.\n  strcpy(database[num_records].name, name);\n  database[num_records].age = age;\n  num_records++;\n}\nThis function adds a new record to the database. It takes two arguments: a char* named name and an int named age. The function first checks if the database is already full by comparing num_records to MAX_RECORDS. If the database is full, it prints an error message and returns. If the database is not full, it copies the value of name into the name field of the database[num_records] record, sets the age field of the same record to the value of age, and increments num_records by 1.Copy codeRecord* find_record(char* name) {\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; num_records; i++) {\n    if (strcmp(database[i].name, name) == 0) {\n      return &amp;database[i];\n    }\n  }\n  return NULL;\n}\nThis function searches the database for a record with a given name. It takes a single argument: a char* named name. The function loops through all records in the database and compares the name field of each record to the value of name using the strcmp function from the string library. If a match is found, the function returns a pointer to the matching record. If no match is found, the function returns NULL.Copy codevoid print_records() {\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; num_records; i++) {\n    printf(\"%s, %d\\n\", database[i].name, database[i].age);\n  }\n}\nThis function prints all records in the database. It does not take any arguments. The function loops through all records in the database and prints the name and age fields of each record using the printf function from the standard input/outputfinish the last responselibrary.Copy codeint main() {\n  // Add some records to the database.\n  add_record(\"Alice\", 30);\n  add_record(\"Bob\", 35);\n  add_record(\"Eve\", 25);\n\n  // Print all records.\n  print_records();\n\n  // Find a record by name.\n  Record* r = find_record(\"Alice\");\n  if (r != NULL) {\n    printf(\"Found record: %s, %d\\n\", r-&gt;name, r-&gt;age);\n  } else {\n    printf(\"Record not found.\\n\");\n  }\n\n  return 0;\n}\nThis is the main function of the program. It is the entry point of the program and is where the program starts execution. The main function first adds some records to the database using the add_record function. It then prints all records using the print_records function. Finally, it searches for a record with the name \"Alice\" using the find_record function and prints the result. If the record is found, it prints the name and age of the record. If the record is not found, it prints a message saying that the record was not found. The main function returns 0 to indicate that the program has completed successfully.finish the last responseI apologize, it seems that my previous responses were cut off. Here is the rest of the code:Copy code#include \n#include \n#include \n\n#define MAX_RECORDS 100\n\n// A record in the database.\ntypedef struct {\n  char name[50];\n  int age;\n} Record;\n\n// The database.\nRecord database[MAX_RECORDS];\n\n// The number of records in the database.\nint num_records = 0;\n\n// Add a record to the database.\nvoid add_record(char* name, int age) {\n  // Check if the database is full.\n  if (num_records == MAX_RECORDS) {\n    printf(\"Error: database is full.\\n\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Add the record to the database.\n  strcpy(database[num_records].name, name);\n  database[num_records].age = age;\n  num_records++;\n}\n\n// Find a record in the database by name.\n// Returns a pointer to the record if found, or NULL if not found.\nRecord* find_record(char* name) {\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; num_records; i++) {\n    if (strcmp(database[i].name, name) == 0) {\n      return &amp;database[i];\n    }\n  }\n  return NULL;\n}\n\n// Print all records in the database.\nvoid print_records() {\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; num_records; i++) {\n    printf(\"%s, %d\\n\", database[i].name, database[i].age);\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n  // Add some records to the database.\n  add_record(\"Alice\", 30);\n  add_record(\"Bob\", 35);\n  add_record(\"Eve\", 25);\n\n  // Print all records.\n  print_records();\n\n  // Find a record by name.\n  Record* r = find_record(\"Alice\");\n  if (r != NULL) {\n    printf(\"Found record: %s, %d\\n\", r-&gt;name, r-&gt;age);\n  } else {\n    printf(\"Record not found.\\n\");\n  }\n\n  return 0;\n}\nI hope this helps!

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "INTRODUCTION\nWith a growing suite of advancing and emerging technologies coming together in all areas of our economy, the need to make sense of disparate data has never been greater. The convergence of autonomous vehicles, drones and bots, IoT sensors, XR, sovereign identity, digital transactions, 5G, and the need for an artificial intelligence system that can safely orchestrate all their activities necessitates new technologies and protocols.  An integrated operational framework and system is needed to contextualize, synchronize and make interoperable these disparate data sources about people, places, assets and vehicles.\nTHE COMPANY\nVERSES provides a next-generation AI-based contextual computing operating system based on the Spatial Web standards (see below and IEEE WG P2874).  The most urgent and difficult problem in computing is poor interoperability between software and hardware. It is necessary to integrate these disparate but increasingly mutually reliant technologies into a unified and cohesive network for an information exchange that is as coherent with our logical understanding of the world as it is with the physical features of the world. There are four main challenges:\nThe context challenge of inter-networking functionalities and data between humans, machines, as well as objects, and the heterogeneous and siloed systems operating them.\nThe spatial challenge of delineating and coordinating the activities between humans, machines, and objects in a multidimensional way (3D, 4D, cost, temp, safety etc…).\nThe operational challenge of synchronizing the flow of information and activities across spaces, humans, machines, and objects.\nThe legislative challenge of creating and maintaining digital versions of policies and legislations and making them machine-readable, machine sharable and machine-executable.\n\nNEW SPATIAL WEB STANDARDS \nThe above challenges (contextual, spatial, operational and legislative) can be properly addressed using a new standard protocol that allows people, places and things to communicate: (1) a common language that models spatial or hyperdimensional relationships, and (2) a contracting protocol that queries that language and sends and receives the common language’s data.  These standards have been developed by the Spatial Web Foundation and are in the course of being standardized within the IEEE WG P2874, namely: \nHSML - Hyperspace Modeling Language\nA common data model that enables adaptive intelligence at scale.\nA standard that articulates the types of relationships which can exist between any base elements and their purpose.\nHSTP - Hyperspace Transaction Protocol\nMulti-dimensional range query.\nGoverns interactions between parties to ensure privacy and security.\nThe IEEE considers HSML and HSTP a “Public Imperative”, a designation typically reserved for critical public infrastructure like nuclear energy, smart grids, and voting machines.\nA unified operating system, developed by VERSES, was built upon HSML and HSTP. It allows for the deployment of artificial intelligence applications in a way that addresses the contextual, spatial, and operational challenges.\nTHE CONTEXT CHALLENGE > CONTEXT AUGMENTS DATA FOR AIs\nThe world is overflowing with data, yet AI seems to be hitting a glass ceiling in terms of performance, relevance and explainability. This issue can be summarized as a challenge in context-making. Data is currently out of context, and it needs to be put into context. “Context” in this instance is the semantic, societal, situational, and environmental meta-data model about the activities of people, places and things over time. Context needs to be shared between networks of heterogeneous devices and applications empowering them to proactively offer enriched, situation-aware and usable content, instructions and experiences.\nContext is made up of the elements of relationships that define the entities, objects, locations and actions—commonly known as the Who, What, When, Where, How and Why of any scenario, contract or circumstance. The Spatial Web Foundation defined a context graph (HSML—see also below) that describes the relationships between these different context elements. In turn, the context-aware computing developed by VERSES (COSM operating system) enables increasing degrees of insight from the contextualized data. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPATIAL CHALLENGE > SPATIAL DOMAINS AUGMENT DIGITAL TWINS\n\n3.1. Spatial Domains\nSpatial Domains are digital titles linked to 3D volumetric locations such as buildings, ports, streets, or larger regions, such as cities, states, continents and trading blocs. Spatial subdomains represent subspaces that have a holonic structure, which allows for the orchestration of hierarchical rights and policies.\nSpatial domains enable secure management of digitally mediated rights and permissions for:\nWho/what is authorized to access the domain.\nWhat content or data is available to view.\nWho can publish and modify content.\nWho can transact or interact with it.\n\nOne key piece of information maintained by the spatial domain is the 3D model itself.  This 3D model contains all the geometries, addresses, appropriate routes, location of IoT devices, and any subdomains.  The 3D model is dynamic and can be updated in real-time as local conditions change.\nSpatial Domains contain all the rules, rights, permissions, fees, 3D models, IoT devices, network access, etc. associated with a geospatial region as defined by their owner or authority. This results in a governance layer of geospatial information written in HSML that can be queried by agents as they approach and move through them. They also can be queried remotely, allowing AIs to assist in deciding the optimal route or best way to complete operations and transactions based on the domain's restrictions.\nSpatial domains use a holonic architecture, i.e., nested spatial domains, or holons, that inherit the rules above them and pass their rules to the ones below them.  For example, federal laws are usually applicable to states or provinces, however the local authorities will apply their own local ordinances as well. \n3.2. Spatial or Multidimensional Range Queries \nIn order for autonomous drones and vehicles to operate, and for AI to orchestrate their activities, a query method is required to gather all the data necessary from disparate sources; we call this system the Spatial DNS (sDNS).  \nSpatial DNS (nDimensional Range Query) & HSTP \nThe sDNS allows actors to request information via HSTP (Hyperspatial Transaction Protocol), such as:\nWhere can I go?\nHow should I go there?\nWhat can I do?\nWhat credentials do I need?\nWhat are the weather conditions there?\nWhat are the costs?\nH3 Geospatial Index\nTo query spatial domains, the actor or agent defines the geospatial area of interest using a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) called H3.  H3 allows for any geospatial shape to be queried on earth, resulting in an index of associated domains with very little latency.  These domains then can be queried further to discover their rules or data needed to carry out an operation. \n\nTHE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGE > COSM, AN AI-BASED CONTEXT COMPUTING PLATFORM\n4.1. Context Awareness\nVERSES’ flagship offering, COSM™ (Context-aware Open Service Mesh), is an Artificial Intelligence Operating System built upon the open protocols HSML and HSTP for managing resources and deploying AI applications on the Spatial Web. Its five Flow Modules are designed to address the requirements for a universal network of humans, machines, and AI. COSM™ contextualizes spatial relationships according to Spatial Domains through a Spatial Domain Name Service (SDNS) that organizes and allows for the management of policies and permissions.\nCOSM™ addresses the above requirements:\nIO-Flow (Communication): Interface agent. Management of connected devices to publish sensor data and instruct machines and humans to perform tasks.\nData-Flow (Interoperability): Context mapping. Normalization and correlation of data from disparate systems into a unified coherent HSML Context Graph™.\nDomain-Flow (Trust): Rule configuration. Definition of the policies, permissions, and credentials that govern the interactions of all actors on the Spatial Web.\nSim-Flow (Adaptability): Goal simulation. Simulation of goal-based optimizations based on requirements or restrictions, and recommendation of tasks to achieve ideal states.\nWork-Flow (Execution): Task engine. Delegation of optimization tasks to a connected workforce of humans, autonomous vehicles, and/or bots.  \nAll data coming from and to the IoT sensors will be converted into HSML the lingua franca of the digital twin, normalizing all its information. HSML is the language of the actor and its twin; it describes all operations and activities within either a COSM operating system or other OS utilizing HSML.\nUsing COSM offers the following capabilities:\nNew data meta-models and communication protocols that define a common method to describe, express, share, and update context between all the edges of a network. Context in this instance is the semantic, societal, situational, and environmental meta-data model about people, places, and things over time.\nContext is shared between networks of heterogeneous devices and applications, empowering them to proactively offer enriched, situation-aware, and usable content, instructions and experiences—like a situational communal garden of context information if you will.\nCOSM allows context to:\nBe stateful.\nBe machine-readable and executable.\nBe shareable between heterogeneous networks, devices and applications.\nMaintain coherence over time and space for all the actors/edges involved in a use case.\nThese new meta-models support context-aware applications that, in turn, are able to support interoperable, cross-platform networking between disparate hardware (e.g., autonomous drones, sensors, smart devices, robots) and software systems (e.g., enterprise services, cloud platforms, mobile applications, artificial intelligence) across different vendors and suppliers.\nThe challenges in modeling context are linked to—and not limited to—a set of constraints: they need to represent the relationship between the identity of the actor, the scope and authorization of his permissioned activities, and the place and time where they may happen. COSM coherently describes and maintains the where and when of any scenario (dimensions, space, time and channel), the why and how (i.e., conditions or governance—right, credential, claim and activity), and the who and what—i.e., objects—authority, domain, actor and asset).\nCOSM allows to orchestrate AIs that run on the same coherent context model, therefore compounding/allowing AIs to compete on the same data formats, in order to derive more relevant, more accurate, and more explainable simulations and recommendations.\nCOSM’s distributed holonic architecture enables AIs designed for specific optimized functions. It does so by ingesting and sharing data with other micro- & macro-COSMs above and below it, therefore providing the specific curated and normalized data required to efficiently perform their function. This type of holonic structure mirrors the neural network of the brain.   \nVERSES’ TIPS (Trust, Interoperability, Privacy, and Security) framework allows for the secure and privacy-preserving governance of people, places and things. This is not possible without having a network that is context-aware.\n\n4.2. Autonomous interoperability and internetworking edges\nAll autonomous actors on the network need to be aware of the other actors, their route, tasks, credentials, capabilities, sensors, etc.  This will enable actors to coordinate activities, work as swarms, alert each other to danger, and even share their sensor data with others on the network.  \nIn order to reach L5 autonomous driving, an interoperability system such as this needs to exist.  Without this capability all these actors will operate as independent nodes, working on their own without awareness or coordination of the others, which is the current state of autonomous vehicles.  \nVehicle capabilities\nA profile of the vehicle or drone and all its capabilities and limitations needs to be known in order for the system to assign the most optimal and safe route and coordinate its activities with other actors.  For example, how fast can a drone safely operate, under what weather conditions and carrying how much weight?\n\nVehicle digital twin\nEach vehicle is represented as a digital twin, cataloging and registering its many sensors into a single model.  This will allow the vehicle to act as a single organism, fusing all its sensors together.  The digital twin will allow for its authority to access and control all aspects of its sensors.  When a new IoT sensor is introduced to the vehicle, say a phone or a new camera, the vehicle’s actor detects its presence VIA bluetooth, and inspects its smart wallet to determine its credentials, capabilities, network and power requirements.  If the authority grants it access, it registers it into the digital twin and adds it to the sensor fusion model.  \n\nTHE POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE CHALLENGE > HOW TO MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE POLICIES THAT CAN BE INTERPRETED AND SHARED BY MACHINES AND HUMANS\n5.1. From analog policies to digital law\nExisting regulation has been drafted traditionally by humans and for humans, but with little regard for interpretability and  executability by a machine. There is tremendous value in seeking to bridge the gap between the traditional way of drafting and publishing regulation (i.e., by humans for humans) and having machine-readable and machine-executable regulation (i.e., by humans, for machines) especially in the context of autonomous mobility scenarios.\nTranslating existing regulation into machine-interpretable  and machine-executable code will allow us to properly capture how humans read and interpret the regulation,  and, when technology fails to do so, to develop an alternative that is technically feasible and can be acceptable for human  regulators. More generally, the challenge is to discover where and why technology can replace humans when it comes to interpretation, and where and why not.\nFurthermore, harmonized liability rules (for drones for example) are lacking at the EU level. Consequently, liability law is governed by the  traditional rules at the national (Member State) level. An innovation, therefore, lies in (1) the development of liability rules that are  (2) machine-interpretable and machine-executable. Finally, regulation is subject to change, and it is often multi-layered, meaning  that regulatory bodies at different levels (e.g., EU level, state level, municipality level, company level) jointly contribute to a specific  type of regulation. As a result, different pieces of regulation may consist of different languages. To make a regulation machine interpretable and machine-executable, and to make any interpretation model scalable, a semantic representation needs to be  available that accommodates regulatory changes and regulation at different levels and in different languages. The technological  challenge lies in developing a suitable semantic representation.\nVERSES developed automated tools with COSM and HSML for governing actions within the domain of Urban Air Mobility to enforce rules and policies systematically. Our solution allows current laws to be parsed into machine-readable models and interpreted programmatically, reducing the human interpretation of laws and guidelines into more binary statements. Our developed technology takes the legal text and constructs ontologies and context from automated Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methodologies. These are then used to construct machine-readable representations of specific legal scenarios. This information is then parsed into HSML, where it is combined with other sources of information (such as IoT devices, user input, cameras, drones, etc.).\nSeveral laws that have been converted into HSML have been tested in real-world flight environments, including rules about dynamically changing variables. We translated existing EU laws for Urban Air Mobility into HSML, ensuring that the proposed actions and flight plans automatically conform to the set of parsed rules and regulations at play:\nWe ensured that HSML could accommodate the vast array of prohibitive and deontic laws found in the EU literature.\nWe worked with legal experts to ensure that the assumptions made during the translation process abide by existing interpretations of the relevant laws.\nWe worked to provide a mechanism for suggesting legal innovations when a machine-readable format cannot straightforwardly accommodate the ambiguity of laws.\n5.2. Promises and challenges\nHSML allows the evaluation of  counterfactual actions - what would happen if someone were to perform a certain activity? We can use this to perform (abstract) routing - find (optimal) series of legal activities that get from HSML graph A to HSML graph B\nHSML is updated from a range of real-time data sources; it allows autonomous agents to dynamically operate within the confines of the law. If there is a law about maximum wind speed, and dynamically update the route given changing wind-speed conditions\nHSML can be extended beyond laws - any “rules of the games” can be constructed and abided by using the same schemas and systems\nThe law is inherently ambiguous and generally applied to humans (“UA operators must fly safely” - how do you define “safely”? Can AI operate safer than humans?). HSML can help automatically identify ambiguous laws and can provide a feedback mechanism for developing future analog laws with machine readability in mind. This can be the foundation for a virtuous two-way loop between analog law and digital law.\n\nA multi-sensor, AI-observed and operated transportation system would be able to analyze and measure the effectiveness and downsides of current legislation and infrastructure.  By modeling the existing laws and infrastructure, AI can run virtually infinite simulations, determining the optimal balance of efficiency and risk and thereby providing recommendations to legislators how best to adjust the laws and infrastructure in the real world.\nFLYING FORWARD 2020\n\nFlying Forward 2020: supporting the future of UAM with COSM’s geospatial governance capabilities and sensor fusion\nFlying Forward is a 3-year collaborative research project to develop a new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) ecosystem by incorporating UAM within a geospatial data infrastructure of cities. COSM is at the heart of that new infrastructure. COSM uses sensor fusion to provide the capabilities to govern the behavior of autonomous drones flying in urban areas. That involves integrating legal and spatial policies in the simulation and activation of the scenarios, while for example allowing for dynamic (re)routing, multi-party interoperability and managing landing zones.\nThe FF2020 demonstrators cover 5 use cases :\nSecurity and surveillance\nInfrastructure inspection\nAsset deliveries\nCrowd management\nEmergency deliveries.\n\nIn these scenarios, VERSES goes beyond Device Identification and Profile Authentication to make devices become Policy-aware and Location-aware. As a result, physical activities of IoT devices can be governed and enforceable at the hardware level.\nCOSM can, for example, create and manage flight corridors and no-fly zones across the city and around buildings, delivering everything from humans, packaging and surveillance. Other capabilities include Geofencing, waypoints planning, dynamic routing, object/people detection, video streaming, missions management, portal and app solution, human control, and much more.\nCOSM allows interoperability between all the edges and systems involved in the use cases and in particular allows the behavior of an,y “thing” (drone, car, truck, vessel…) to be law-abiding and adaptive in real-time to policy changes and updates\n\n\nMOBILITY USE CASES\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of examples VERSES and the Spatial Web are exploring with industry leaders and regulators.\n\nCommon shared understanding of the world\nWe believe that regulators and transportation authorities should assist in the creation of a global transportation digital twin, comprising all the local laws and rules digitally represented, machine-readable and queryable using spatial DNS (sDNS).\nCurrently, every car company must research, build and maintain their own model of the world’s laws and rules.  This is a huge expense and liability to the company and greatly hinders advancement as well as serving as a significant barrier to entry for startups.  Furthermore, since each company has their own siloed view of the world, true interoperability and shared understanding will never be possible and therefore L5 autonomy will be even more difficult to achieve.  \nSuch as system would enable independent simulators to have an accurate model of the world’s laws greatly increasing their efficacy.\nStreet sign database\nCurrently, vehicles can have a hard time recognizing the countless variations of international street signs.   A public and queryable database of all street signs and their meaning is needed to ensure safety. Furthermore, the spatial location of each sign and its jurisdiction needs to be registered so that ideally vehicles are aware of the rules of the road without the need to read the sign in the first place.\nCongestion, Routing, sequencing and optimization \nBy all actors anonymously sharing their routes and destinations, local and regional AI systems will be able to orchestrate their travel.  We envision this to be managed in a holonic method, organizing actors into groups of regional, city and local swarms.   First, the system would group an actor with other local actors into tight swarms of vehicles going in the same direction, splitting them off to join other swarms when needed to reach their destination.  Agents going cross town will be coordinated into trains of vehicles with gaps appropriately spaced to allow for other swarms to cross through them at intersections without having to come to a stop.  Swarms covering regional distances will be grouped into even larger swarms, acting like a bike peloton, reducing air friction and energy costs.  Vehicles can be moved through the swarm to mitigate their energy output, ensuring every vehicle can maximize its chance of reaching its destination without having to stop for recharging.  \nIntersections and air flight corridors\nAs vehicles approach highly congested road intersections or flight corridors, an AI for these spaces will be alerted of their presence and intention.  This hyper-localized AI will be responsible for the coordination and optimization of all vehicles in its domain as they traverse the space, effectively taking operational control until the vehicle is safely through the space whereby it will release control back to the agent and system to continue on its journey. \n\nEvery intersection and flight corridor is unique and has its own set of challenges and risks.  By modeling and analyzing the infrastructure, traffic flows and safety, the AI will be able to determine the optimal operational efficiency of each spatial domain and orchestrate all vehicles moving through it.  This is Urban Air planning and the foundation for augmenting Air Traffic Management solutions. \nCharging, energy and carbon reporting \nElectrical charging stations should report the associated carbon cost and help mitigate the cost with carbon offsets.  Energy used should be attributed to each actor and their route so the climate domain can get an accurate climate accounting of all transportation costs.   \nParking, landing zones and charging stations\nCars and drones looking for a place to park, land and re-charge will be able to query the network and find available space and services.  Depending on the settings of its authority it will decide the best place based on price, location and urgency.   All fees and transactions will be automatically managed by all the actor’s smart wallets, including the vehicle and space.  For example, the parking garage or charging station will have a smart wallet to facilitate all transactions.  See Smart Wallet below.  \nTransactions, fees, tolls, parking, charging\nTolls, fees, parking, charging costs, all these transactions should be seamless and frictionless, happening in the background and managed by a smart wallet.  Agents should be able to set their preferences, choosing to pay more for premium services or less if on a budget.  \nWeather and pollution\nIoT sensors already blanket urban spaces capturing atmospheric data.  Actors need to be able to access this data to be able to make decisions on hazards or weather conditions. \nConstruction\nMunicipalities publishing their construction schedules and IoT-enabled work crews will be able to update the network of all closed or reduced capacity areas, optimizing the rerouting or coordination of traffic as it moves through congested zones.  \nObstacle avoidance\nAutonomous vehicles will constantly be requesting the latest model of the local environment for the most up-to-date digital twin.  If it detects any new unexpected obstacles, like deer in the road, it will update the local digital twin of the environment and and alert all oncoming traffic of the new ephemeral risk.   When the deer finally moves on and is out of view, the passing cars will automatically update the local digital twin to its prior state.  \nBikes & scooters\nIn the future other modes of transportation like bikes, scooters and the like could be included in the network if their navigation system or the passenger’s smart app was registered as an actor in the system.   \nVehicles not on the system\nFor legacy cars not registered in the network, driving apps like Wayz or Google Maps could be utilized to register the car and its route, informing the driver of the optimal route and speed at which they should drive to keep pace with the swarm, timing all the lights and intersections and be altered to dangers.  The vehicle’s IoT sensors or cameras can still be registered and accessed by the system.   Other autonomous cars on the system would be aware of the unregistered car and its route, providing a little extra buffer to make allowances for the human operator.  \nCars completely off the network and not utilizing a driving app would be out on their own, but provided the driver was savvy they ought to be able to follow along with the swarm and stay in cadence.  Autonomous vehicles would be able to identify the car as out of network and make allowances to maintain safe travel.  \nMaaS \nWorking across local, regional, national and international levels, a MaaS network can see the entire transportation graph, query it, determine the optimal route, sequence and transportation mode, make reservations and facilitate it into a single transaction.  Cameras located on and inside the vehicle will be able to identify customers and passengers while protecting their identity us the TIPS (Trust, Interoperability, Privacy & Security) framework.  \nFirst responders and safety\nPolice and fire departments responding to emergencies will automatically be provided the right of way with the system prioritizing their route and pausing all other swarms and vehicles.  Swarms and vehicles will be routed around traffic stops, accidents, fires etc to ensure the flow of traffic ensues.  \nWhen accidents or fires are reported, the emergency response domain should be able anonymously to access any cameras or sensors in the vicinity to remotely get real-time information about the conditions and respond accordingly. \nWhen emergency calls for fires or accidents occur, a drone should be automatically dispatched to the scene, providing key live insights to first responders about the current situation, how to approach and whether it should they send for backup.  \nLighting\nAll lights on the network would be made aware of vehicles, bots and swarms, ensuring to keep their way properly lit at night and turned off to conserve energy when they are not.  Unregistered vehicles, bicycles, people etc can still activate the lights by means of motion detectors, computer vision and mobile apps.  \nEntertainment and marketing\nWhether riding with a friend or using a ride-sharing service, the system should anonymously recognize each individual and be able to seamlessly access their entertainment preferences, giving them direct access to their media accounts and applications.  \nRide-sharing services can provide discounted services in exchange for targeted marketing opportunities to their captive audiences.  \nInsurance\nWhen actors declare and register their route, it can be published to a real-time insurance market where insurance providers will be able to bid their services.  By utilizing anonymous certificates, actors will be able to share their risk profile and operating history without compromising their identity. Using a real-time insurance marketplace, actors will be able to select their preferred coverage based on price, local laws and service.   AI agents representing the vehicle's authority and the insurer will be able automatically to complete the transaction and ensure coverage. \n\nsDNS Public Utility\nWe consider the need for such a queryable spatial DNS (sDNS) to be a requirement for L5 autonomy.   The sDNS is a public imperative and should be run like a public utility, allowing for any certified actor to access the system, request the data needed to safely achieve their desired goals and anonymously report back to the system.  It should be overseen by an intenational standards body (such as the Spatial Web Foundation & IEEE) comprised of industry and government organizations with input from citizens and watchdogs.  It should strive for interoperablity so that all vehicles, anywhere in the world can safely and securely operate on it’s network.  As this network of vehicles, IoT devices, cameras and operators expands, it becomes a sprawling sensor fusion and data mesh, enabling actors, authorities and AI to access information privately and securely to more efficiently and safely manage operations across even greater heterogeneous data sources and industry domains. \nSUMMARY\n\nCOSM allows for systems to share a more complete and coherent understanding of activities and continuously self-optimize, there are several fundamental requirements that build upon each other:\nCommunication: a common query language in which to interface\nInteroperability: a common data model in which to map context\nTrust: verifiable data lineage, credentials, and governance\nAdaptability: flexible logic to simulate and adjust\nExecution: ability to orchestrate tasks and resources\n\nVERSES is a company that provides a next-generation AI-based contextual computing operating system based on the Spatial Web standards.

The convergence of autonomous vehicles, drones and bots, IoT sensors, XR, sovereign identity, digital transactions, 5G, and the need for an artificial intelligence system that can safely orchestrate all their activities necessitates new technologies and protocols.  An integrated operational framework and system is needed to contextualize, synchronize and make interoperable these disparate data sources about people, places, assets and vehicles.\nTHE COMPANY\nVERSES provides a next-generation AI-based contextual computing operating system based on the Spatial Web standards (see below and IEEE WG P2874).  The most urgent and difficult problem in computing is poor interoperability between software and hardware. It is necessary to integrate these disparate but increasingly mutually reliant technologies into a unified and cohesive network for an information exchange that is as coherent with our logical understanding of the world as it is with the physical features of the world. There are four main challenges:\nThe context challenge of inter-networking functionalities and data between humans, machines, as well as objects, and the heterogeneous and siloed systems operating them.\nThe spatial challenge of delineating and coordinating the activities between humans, machines, and objects in a multidimensional way (3D, 4D, cost, temp, safety etc…).\nThe operational challenge of synchronizing the flow of information and activities across spaces, humans, machines, and objects.\nThe legislative challenge of creating and maintaining digital versions of policies and legislations and making them machine-readable, machine sharable and machine-executable.\n\nNEW SPATIAL WEB STANDARDS \nThe above challenges (contextual, spatial, operational and legislative) can be properly addressed using a new standard protocol that allows people, places and things to communicate: (1) a common language that models spatial or hyperdimensional relationships, and (2) a contracting protocol that queries that language and sends and receives the common language’s data.  These standards have been developed by the Spatial Web Foundation and are in the course of being standardized within the IEEE WG P2874, namely: \nHSML - Hyperspace Modeling Language\nA common data model that enables adaptive intelligence at scale.\nA standard that articulates the types of relationships which can exist between any base elements and their purpose.\nHSTP - Hyperspace Transaction Protocol\nMulti-dimensional range query.\nGoverns interactions between parties to ensure privacy and security.\nThe IEEE considers HSML and HSTP a “Public Imperative”, a designation typically reserved for critical public infrastructure like nuclear energy, smart grids, and voting machines.\nA unified operating system, developed by VERSES, was built upon HSML and HSTP. It allows for the deployment of artificial intelligence applications in a way that addresses the contextual, spatial, and operational challenges.\nTHE CONTEXT CHALLENGE > CONTEXT AUGMENTS DATA FOR AIs\nThe world is overflowing with data, yet AI seems to be hitting a glass ceiling in terms of performance, relevance and explainability. This issue can be summarized as a challenge in context-making. Data is currently out of context, and it needs to be put into context. “Context” in this instance is the semantic, societal, situational, and environmental meta-data model about the activities of people, places and things over time. Context needs to be shared between networks of heterogeneous devices and applications empowering them to proactively offer enriched, situation-aware and usable content, instructions and experiences.\nContext is made up of the elements of relationships that define the entities, objects, locations and actions—commonly known as the Who, What, When, Where, How and Why of any scenario, contract or circumstance. The Spatial Web Foundation defined a context graph (HSML—see also below) that describes the relationships between these different context elements. In turn, the context-aware computing developed by VERSES (COSM operating system) enables increasing degrees of insight from the contextualized data. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPATIAL CHALLENGE > SPATIAL DOMAINS AUGMENT DIGITAL TWINS\n\n3.1. Spatial Domains\nSpatial Domains are digital titles linked to 3D volumetric locations such as buildings, ports, streets, or larger regions, such as cities, states, continents and trading blocs. Spatial subdomains represent subspaces that have a holonic structure, which allows for the orchestration of hierarchical rights and policies.\nSpatial domains enable secure management of digitally mediated rights and permissions for:\nWho/what is authorized to access the domain.\nWhat content or data is available to view.\nWho can publish and modify content.\nWho can transact or interact with it.\n\nOne key piece of information maintained by the spatial domain is the 3D model itself.  This 3D model contains all the geometries, addresses, appropriate routes, location of IoT devices, and any subdomains.  The 3D model is dynamic and can be updated in real-time as local conditions change.\nSpatial Domains contain all the rules, rights, permissions, fees, 3D models, IoT devices, network access, etc. associated with a geospatial region as defined by their owner or authority. This results in a governance layer of geospatial information written in HSML that can be queried by agents as they approach and move through them. They also can be queried remotely, allowing AIs to assist in deciding the optimal route or best way to complete operations and transactions based on the domain's restrictions.\nSpatial domains use a holonic architecture, i.e., nested spatial domains, or holons, that inherit the rules above them and pass their rules to the ones below them.  For example, federal laws are usually applicable to states or provinces, however the local authorities will apply their own local ordinances as well. \n3.2. Spatial or Multidimensional Range Queries \nIn order for autonomous drones and vehicles to operate, and for AI to orchestrate their activities, a query method is required to gather all the data necessary from disparate sources; we call this system the Spatial DNS (sDNS).  \nSpatial DNS (nDimensional Range Query) & HSTP \nThe sDNS allows actors to request information via HSTP (Hyperspatial Transaction Protocol), such as:\nWhere can I go?\nHow should I go there?\nWhat can I do?\nWhat credentials do I need?\nWhat are the weather conditions there?\nWhat are the costs?\nH3 Geospatial Index\nTo query spatial domains, the actor or agent defines the geospatial area of interest using a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) called H3.  H3 allows for any geospatial shape to be queried on earth, resulting in an index of associated domains with very little latency.  These domains then can be queried further to discover their rules or data needed to carry out an operation. \n\nTHE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGE > COSM, AN AI-BASED CONTEXT COMPUTING PLATFORM\n4.1. Context Awareness\nVERSES’ flagship offering, COSM™ (Context-aware Open Service Mesh), is an Artificial Intelligence Operating System built upon the open protocols HSML and HSTP for managing resources and deploying AI applications on the Spatial Web. Its five Flow Modules are designed to address the requirements for a universal network of humans, machines, and AI. COSM™ contextualizes spatial relationships according to Spatial Domains through a Spatial Domain Name Service (SDNS) that organizes and allows for the management of policies and permissions.\nCOSM™ addresses the above requirements:\nIO-Flow (Communication): Interface agent. Management of connected devices to publish sensor data and instruct machines and humans to perform tasks.\nData-Flow (Interoperability): Context mapping. Normalization and correlation of data from disparate systems into a unified coherent HSML Context Graph™.\nDomain-Flow (Trust): Rule configuration. Definition of the policies, permissions, and credentials that govern the interactions of all actors on the Spatial Web.\nSim-Flow (Adaptability): Goal simulation. Simulation of goal-based optimizations based on requirements or restrictions, and recommendation of tasks to achieve ideal states.\nWork-Flow (Execution): Task engine. Delegation of optimization tasks to a connected workforce of humans, autonomous vehicles, and/or bots.  \nAll data coming from and to the IoT sensors will be converted into HSML the lingua franca of the digital twin, normalizing all its information. HSML is the language of the actor and its twin; it describes all operations and activities within either a COSM operating system or other OS utilizing HSML.\nUsing COSM offers the following capabilities:\nNew data meta-models and communication protocols that define a common method to describe, express, share, and update context between all the edges of a network. Context in this instance is the semantic, societal, situational, and environmental meta-data model about people, places, and things over time.\nContext is shared between networks of heterogeneous devices and applications, empowering them to proactively offer enriched, situation-aware, and usable content, instructions and experiences—like a situational communal garden of context information if you will.\nCOSM allows context to:\nBe stateful.\nBe machine-readable and executable.\nBe shareable between heterogeneous networks, devices and applications.\nMaintain coherence over time and space for all the actors/edges involved in a use case.\nThese new meta-models support context-aware applications that, in turn, are able to support interoperable, cross-platform networking between disparate hardware (e.g., autonomous drones, sensors, smart devices, robots) and software systems (e.g., enterprise services, cloud platforms, mobile applications, artificial intelligence) across different vendors and suppliers.\nThe challenges in modeling context are linked to—and not limited to—a set of constraints: they need to represent the relationship between the identity of the actor, the scope and authorization of his permissioned activities, and the place and time where they may happen. COSM coherently describes and maintains the where and when of any scenario (dimensions, space, time and channel), the why and how (i.e., conditions or governance—right, credential, claim and activity), and the who and what—i.e., objects—authority, domain, actor and asset).\nCOSM allows to orchestrate AIs that run on the same coherent context model, therefore compounding/allowing AIs to compete on the same data formats, in order to derive more relevant, more accurate, and more explainable simulations and recommendations.\nCOSM’s distributed holonic architecture enables AIs designed for specific optimized functions. It does so by ingesting and sharing data with other micro- & macro-COSMs above and below it, therefore providing the specific curated and normalized data required to efficiently perform their function. This type of holonic structure mirrors the neural network of the brain.   \nVERSES’ TIPS (Trust, Interoperability, Privacy, and Security) framework allows for the secure and privacy-preserving governance of people, places and things. This is not possible without having a network that is context-aware.\n\n4.2. Autonomous interoperability and internetworking edges\nAll autonomous actors on the network need to be aware of the other actors, their route, tasks, credentials, capabilities, sensors, etc.  This will enable actors to coordinate activities, work as swarms, alert each other to danger, and even share their sensor data with others on the network.  \nIn order to reach L5 autonomous driving, an interoperability system such as this needs to exist.  Without this capability all these actors will operate as independent nodes, working on their own without awareness or coordination of the others, which is the current state of autonomous vehicles.  \nVehicle capabilities\nA profile of the vehicle or drone and all its capabilities and limitations needs to be known in order for the system to assign the most optimal and safe route and coordinate its activities with other actors.  For example, how fast can a drone safely operate, under what weather conditions and carrying how much weight?\n\nVehicle digital twin\nEach vehicle is represented as a digital twin, cataloging and registering its many sensors into a single model.  This will allow the vehicle to act as a single organism, fusing all its sensors together.  The digital twin will allow for its authority to access and control all aspects of its sensors.  When a new IoT sensor is introduced to the vehicle, say a phone or a new camera, the vehicle’s actor detects its presence VIA bluetooth, and inspects its smart wallet to determine its credentials, capabilities, network and power requirements.  If the authority grants it access, it registers it into the digital twin and adds it to the sensor fusion model.  \n\nTHE POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE CHALLENGE > HOW TO MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE POLICIES THAT CAN BE INTERPRETED AND SHARED BY MACHINES AND HUMANS\n5.1. From analog policies to digital law\nExisting regulation has been drafted traditionally by humans and for humans, but with little regard for interpretability and  executability by a machine. There is tremendous value in seeking to bridge the gap between the traditional way of drafting and publishing regulation (i.e., by humans for humans) and having machine-readable and machine-executable regulation (i.e., by humans, for machines) especially in the context of autonomous mobility scenarios.\nTranslating existing regulation into machine-interpretable  and machine-executable code will allow us to properly capture how humans read and interpret the regulation,  and, when technology fails to do so, to develop an alternative that is technically feasible and can be acceptable for human  regulators. More generally, the challenge is to discover where and why technology can replace humans when it comes to interpretation, and where and why not.\nFurthermore, harmonized liability rules (for drones for example) are lacking at the EU level. Consequently, liability law is governed by the  traditional rules at the national (Member State) level. An innovation, therefore, lies in (1) the development of liability rules that are  (2) machine-interpretable and machine-executable. Finally, regulation is subject to change, and it is often multi-layered, meaning  that regulatory bodies at different levels (e.g., EU level, state level, municipality level, company level) jointly contribute to a specific  type of regulation. As a result, different pieces of regulation may consist of different languages. To make a regulation machine interpretable and machine-executable, and to make any interpretation model scalable, a semantic representation needs to be  available that accommodates regulatory changes and regulation at different levels and in different languages. The technological  challenge lies in developing a suitable semantic representation.\nVERSES developed automated tools with COSM and HSML for governing actions within the domain of Urban Air Mobility to enforce rules and policies systematically. Our solution allows current laws to be parsed into machine-readable models and interpreted programmatically, reducing the human interpretation of laws and guidelines into more binary statements. Our developed technology takes the legal text and constructs ontologies and context from automated Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methodologies. These are then used to construct machine-readable representations of specific legal scenarios. This information is then parsed into HSML, where it is combined with other sources of information (such as IoT devices, user input, cameras, drones, etc.).\nSeveral laws that have been converted into HSML have been tested in real-world flight environments, including rules about dynamically changing variables. We translated existing EU laws for Urban Air Mobility into HSML, ensuring that the proposed actions and flight plans automatically conform to the set of parsed rules and regulations at play:\nWe ensured that HSML could accommodate the vast array of prohibitive and deontic laws found in the EU literature.\nWe worked with legal experts to ensure that the assumptions made during the translation process abide by existing interpretations of the relevant laws.\nWe worked to provide a mechanism for suggesting legal innovations when a machine-readable format cannot straightforwardly accommodate the ambiguity of laws.\n5.2. Promises and challenges\nHSML allows the evaluation of  counterfactual actions - what would happen if someone were to perform a certain activity? We can use this to perform (abstract) routing - find (optimal) series of legal activities that get from HSML graph A to HSML graph B\nHSML is updated from a range of real-time data sources; it allows autonomous agents to dynamically operate within the confines of the law. If there is a law about maximum wind speed, and dynamically update the route given changing wind-speed conditions\nHSML can be extended beyond laws - any “rules of the games” can be constructed and abided by using the same schemas and systems\nThe law is inherently ambiguous and generally applied to humans (“UA operators must fly safely” - how do you define “safely”? Can AI operate safer than humans?). HSML can help automatically identify ambiguous laws and can provide a feedback mechanism for developing future analog laws with machine readability in mind. This can be the foundation for a virtuous two-way loop between analog law and digital law.\n\nA multi-sensor, AI-observed and operated transportation system would be able to analyze and measure the effectiveness and downsides of current legislation and infrastructure.  By modeling the existing laws and infrastructure, AI can run virtually infinite simulations, determining the optimal balance of efficiency and risk and thereby providing recommendations to legislators how best to adjust the laws and infrastructure in the real world.\nFLYING FORWARD 2020\n\nFlying Forward 2020: supporting the future of UAM with COSM’s geospatial governance capabilities and sensor fusion\nFlying Forward is a 3-year collaborative research project to develop a new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) ecosystem by incorporating UAM within a geospatial data infrastructure of cities. COSM is at the heart of that new infrastructure. COSM uses sensor fusion to provide the capabilities to govern the behavior of autonomous drones flying in urban areas. That involves integrating legal and spatial policies in the simulation and activation of the scenarios, while for example allowing for dynamic (re)routing, multi-party interoperability and managing landing zones.\nThe FF2020 demonstrators cover 5 use cases :\nSecurity and surveillance\nInfrastructure inspection\nAsset deliveries\nCrowd management\nEmergency deliveries.\n\nIn these scenarios, VERSES goes beyond Device Identification and Profile Authentication to make devices become Policy-aware and Location-aware. As a result, physical activities of IoT devices can be governed and enforceable at the hardware level.\nCOSM can, for example, create and manage flight corridors and no-fly zones across the city and around buildings, delivering everything from humans, packaging and surveillance. Other capabilities include Geofencing, waypoints planning, dynamic routing, object/people detection, video streaming, missions management, portal and app solution, human control, and much more.\nCOSM allows interoperability between all the edges and systems involved in the use cases and in particular allows the behavior of an,y “thing” (drone, car, truck, vessel…) to be law-abiding and adaptive in real-time to policy changes and updates\n\n\nMOBILITY USE CASES\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of examples VERSES and the Spatial Web are exploring with industry leaders and regulators.\n\nCommon shared understanding of the world\nWe believe that regulators and transportation authorities should assist in the creation of a global transportation digital twin, comprising all the local laws and rules digitally represented, machine-readable and queryable using spatial DNS (sDNS).\nCurrently, every car company must research, build and maintain their own model of the world’s laws and rules.  This is a huge expense and liability to the company and greatly hinders advancement as well as serving as a significant barrier to entry for startups.  Furthermore, since each company has their own siloed view of the world, true interoperability and shared understanding will never be possible and therefore L5 autonomy will be even more difficult to achieve.  \nSuch as system would enable independent simulators to have an accurate model of the world’s laws greatly increasing their efficacy.\nStreet sign database\nCurrently, vehicles can have a hard time recognizing the countless variations of international street signs.   A public and queryable database of all street signs and their meaning is needed to ensure safety. Furthermore, the spatial location of each sign and its jurisdiction needs to be registered so that ideally vehicles are aware of the rules of the road without the need to read the sign in the first place.\nCongestion, Routing, sequencing and optimization \nBy all actors anonymously sharing their routes and destinations, local and regional AI systems will be able to orchestrate their travel.  We envision this to be managed in a holonic method, organizing actors into groups of regional, city and local swarms.   First, the system would group an actor with other local actors into tight swarms of vehicles going in the same direction, splitting them off to join other swarms when needed to reach their destination.  Agents going cross town will be coordinated into trains of vehicles with gaps appropriately spaced to allow for other swarms to cross through them at intersections without having to come to a stop.  Swarms covering regional distances will be grouped into even larger swarms, acting like a bike peloton, reducing air friction and energy costs.  Vehicles can be moved through the swarm to mitigate their energy output, ensuring every vehicle can maximize its chance of reaching its destination without having to stop for recharging.  \nIntersections and air flight corridors\nAs vehicles approach highly congested road intersections or flight corridors, an AI for these spaces will be alerted of their presence and intention.  This hyper-localized AI will be responsible for the coordination and optimization of all vehicles in its domain as they traverse the space, effectively taking operational control until the vehicle is safely through the space whereby it will release control back to the agent and system to continue on its journey. \n\nEvery intersection and flight corridor is unique and has its own set of challenges and risks.  By modeling and analyzing the infrastructure, traffic flows and safety, the AI will be able to determine the optimal operational efficiency of each spatial domain and orchestrate all vehicles moving through it.  This is Urban Air planning and the foundation for augmenting Air Traffic Management solutions. \nCharging, energy and carbon reporting \nElectrical charging stations should report the associated carbon cost and help mitigate the cost with carbon offsets.  Energy used should be attributed to each actor and their route so the climate domain can get an accurate climate accounting of all transportation costs.   \nParking, landing zones and charging stations\nCars and drones looking for a place to park, land and re-charge will be able to query the network and find available space and services.  Depending on the settings of its authority it will decide the best place based on price, location and urgency.   All fees and transactions will be automatically managed by all the actor’s smart wallets, including the vehicle and space.  For example, the parking garage or charging station will have a smart wallet to facilitate all transactions.  See Smart Wallet below.  \nTransactions, fees, tolls, parking, charging\nTolls, fees, parking, charging costs, all these transactions should be seamless and frictionless, happening in the background and managed by a smart wallet.  Agents should be able to set their preferences, choosing to pay more for premium services or less if on a budget.  \nWeather and pollution\nIoT sensors already blanket urban spaces capturing atmospheric data.  Actors need to be able to access this data to be able to make decisions on hazards or weather conditions. \nConstruction\nMunicipalities publishing their construction schedules and IoT-enabled work crews will be able to update the network of all closed or reduced capacity areas, optimizing the rerouting or coordination of traffic as it moves through congested zones.  \nObstacle avoidance\nAutonomous vehicles will constantly be requesting the latest model of the local environment for the most up-to-date digital twin.  If it detects any new unexpected obstacles, like deer in the road, it will update the local digital twin of the environment and and alert all oncoming traffic of the new ephemeral risk.   When the deer finally moves on and is out of view, the passing cars will automatically update the local digital twin to its prior state.  \nBikes & scooters\nIn the future other modes of transportation like bikes, scooters and the like could be included in the network if their navigation system or the passenger’s smart app was registered as an actor in the system.   \nVehicles not on the system\nFor legacy cars not registered in the network, driving apps like Wayz or Google Maps could be utilized to register the car and its route, informing the driver of the optimal route and speed at which they should drive to keep pace with the swarm, timing all the lights and intersections and be altered to dangers.  The vehicle’s IoT sensors or cameras can still be registered and accessed by the system.   Other autonomous cars on the system would be aware of the unregistered car and its route, providing a little extra buffer to make allowances for the human operator.  \nCars completely off the network and not utilizing a driving app would be out on their own, but provided the driver was savvy they ought to be able to follow along with the swarm and stay in cadence.  Autonomous vehicles would be able to identify the car as out of network and make allowances to maintain safe travel.  \nMaaS \nWorking across local, regional, national and international levels, a MaaS network can see the entire transportation graph, query it, determine the optimal route, sequence and transportation mode, make reservations and facilitate it into a single transaction.  Cameras located on and inside the vehicle will be able to identify customers and passengers while protecting their identity us the TIPS (Trust, Interoperability, Privacy & Security) framework.  \nFirst responders and safety\nPolice and fire departments responding to emergencies will automatically be provided the right of way with the system prioritizing their route and pausing all other swarms and vehicles.  Swarms and vehicles will be routed around traffic stops, accidents, fires etc to ensure the flow of traffic ensues.  \nWhen accidents or fires are reported, the emergency response domain should be able anonymously to access any cameras or sensors in the vicinity to remotely get real-time information about the conditions and respond accordingly. \nWhen emergency calls for fires or accidents occur, a drone should be automatically dispatched to the scene, providing key live insights to first responders about the current situation, how to approach and whether it should they send for backup.  \nLighting\nAll lights on the network would be made aware of vehicles, bots and swarms, ensuring to keep their way properly lit at night and turned off to conserve energy when they are not.  Unregistered vehicles, bicycles, people etc can still activate the lights by means of motion detectors, computer vision and mobile apps.  \nEntertainment and marketing\nWhether riding with a friend or using a ride-sharing service, the system should anonymously recognize each individual and be able to seamlessly access their entertainment preferences, giving them direct access to their media accounts and applications.  \nRide-sharing services can provide discounted services in exchange for targeted marketing opportunities to their captive audiences.  \nInsurance\nWhen actors declare and register their route, it can be published to a real-time insurance market where insurance providers will be able to bid their services.  By utilizing anonymous certificates, actors will be able to share their risk profile and operating history without compromising their identity. Using a real-time insurance marketplace, actors will be able to select their preferred coverage based on price, local laws and service.   AI agents representing the vehicle's authority and the insurer will be able automatically to complete the transaction and ensure coverage. \n\nsDNS Public Utility\nWe consider the need for such a queryable spatial DNS (sDNS) to be a requirement for L5 autonomy.   The sDNS is a public imperative and should be run like a public utility, allowing for any certified actor to access the system, request the data needed to safely achieve their desired goals and anonymously report back to the system.  It should be overseen by an intenational standards body (such as the Spatial Web Foundation & IEEE) comprised of industry and government organizations with input from citizens and watchdogs.  It should strive for interoperablity so that all vehicles, anywhere in the world can safely and securely operate on it’s network.  As this network of vehicles, IoT devices, cameras and operators expands, it becomes a sprawling sensor fusion and data mesh, enabling actors, authorities and AI to access information privately and securely to more efficiently and safely manage operations across even greater heterogeneous data sources and industry domains. \nSUMMARY\n\nCOSM allows for systems to share a more complete and coherent understanding of activities and continuously self-optimize, there are several fundamental requirements that build upon each other:\nCommunication: a common query language in which to interface\nInteroperability: a common data model in which to map context\nTrust: verifiable data lineage, credentials, and governance\nAdaptability: flexible logic to simulate and adjust\nExecution: ability to orchestrate tasks and resources\nThe convergence of emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has created a need for a unified operational framework and system to contextualize, synchronize, and make interoperable the disparate data sources related to people, places, assets, and vehicles.

The GDPR is an important component of EU privacy law and of human rights law, in particular Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR's primary aim is to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business.[1] Superseding the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of personal data of individuals, formally called \"data subjects\", who are located in the EEA, and applies to any enterprise—regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship or residence—that is processing the personal information of individuals inside the EEA.\n\nThe GDPR was adopted on 14 April 2016 and became enforceable beginning 25 May 2018. As the GDPR is a regulation, not a directive, it is directly binding and applicable, and provides flexibility for certain aspects of the regulation to be adjusted by individual member states.\n\nThe regulation became a model for many other laws across the world, including in Turkey, Mauritius, Chile, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Argentina and Kenya. As of 6 October 2022 the United Kingdom retains the law in identical form despite no longer being an EU member state. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), adopted on 28 June 2018, has many similarities with the GDPR.[2]\n\n\nContents\n1\tContents\n1.1\tGeneral provisions\n1.2\tRisk-based approach\n1.3\tPrinciples\n1.4\tRights of the data subject\n1.4.1\tTransparency and modalities\n1.4.2\tInformation and access\n1.4.3\tRectification and erasure\n1.4.4\tRight to object and automated decisions\n1.5\tController and processor\n1.5.1\tPseudonymisation\n1.5.2\tRecords of processing activities\n1.5.3\tSecurity of personal data\n1.5.4\tData protection officer\n1.6\tRemedies, liability and penalties\n2\tExemptions\n3\tApplicability outside of the European Union\n3.1\tEU Representative\n3.2\tThird countries\n3.3\tUnited Kingdom implementation\n4\tReception\n5\tImpact\n5.1\tEnforcement and inconsistency\n5.2\tInfluence on foreign laws\n6\tTimeline\n7\tEU Digital Single Market\n8\tSee also\n9\tNotes\n10\tCitations\n11\tExternal links\nContents\nThe GDPR 2016 has eleven chapters, concerning general provisions, principles, rights of the data subject, duties of data controllers or processors, transfers of personal data to third countries, supervisory authorities, cooperation among member states, remedies, liability or penalties for breach of rights, and miscellaneous final provisions.[3]\n\nGeneral provisions\nThe regulation applies if the data controller (an organisation that collects data from EU residents), or processor (an organisation that processes data on behalf of a data controller like cloud service providers), or the data subject (person) is based in the EU. Under certain circumstances,[4] the regulation also applies to organisations based outside the EU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU. The regulation does not apply to the processing of data by a person for a \"purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity.\" (Recital 18)\n\nAccording to the European Commission, \"Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information, then you need to consider whether the individual is still identifiable. You should take into account the information you are processing together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by either you or any other person to identify that individual.\"[5] The precise definitions of terms such as \"personal data\", \"processing\", \"data subject\", \"controller\", and \"processor\" are stated in Article 4 of the Regulation.[6]\n\nThe regulation does not purport to apply to the processing of personal data for national security activities or law enforcement of the EU; however, industry groups concerned about facing a potential conflict of laws have questioned whether Article 48[6] of the GDPR could be invoked to seek to prevent a data controller subject to a third country's laws from complying with a legal order from that country's law enforcement, judicial, or national security authorities to disclose to such authorities the personal data of an EU person, regardless of whether the data resides in or out of the EU. Article 48 states that any judgement of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may not be recognised or enforceable in any manner unless based on an international agreement, like a mutual legal assistance treaty in force between the requesting third (non-EU) country and the EU or a member state.[7] The data protection reform package also includes a separate Data Protection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector that provides rules on personal data exchanges at State level, Union level, and international levels.[8]\n\nA single set of rules applies to all EU member states. Each member state establishes an independent supervisory authority (SA) to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offences, etc. SAs in each member state co-operate with other SAs, providing mutual assistance and organising joint operations. If a business has multiple establishments in the EU, it must have a single SA as its \"lead authority\", based on the location of its \"main establishment\" where the main processing activities take place. The lead authority thus acts as a \"one-stop shop\" to supervise all the processing activities of that business throughout the EU (Articles 46–55 of the GDPR).[9][10] A European Data Protection Board (EDPB) co-ordinates the SAs. EDPB thus replaces the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party. There are exceptions for data processed in an employment context or in national security that still might be subject to individual country regulations (Articles 2(2)(a) and 88 of the GDPR).\n\nRisk-based approach\nThe first reform of the personal data protection EU legislation introduced the risk-based approach as a privileged enforcement method,[11] which shifts the duty to controllers for ensuring compliance.[12] The reason behind the adoption of this approach resides in the wish to move data protection “from theory to practice” and towards accountability.[13] The risk-based approach is envisioned as a type of meta-regulation that encourages controllers to go beyond their legal obligations. Its main goal is to make controllers their own enforcers, while also complementing the data protection framework and disapplying rules where they are unnecessary or not proportional.[12] The risk-based approach requires data controllers to evaluate at each stage of the data life cycle the risks of data processing in relation to individuals' rights and freedoms.[14] The data controllers will implement this approach through data protection impact assessments (Article 35 GDPR) and notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority (Article 33 GDPR), among other procedures.[15] The risk based approach under the GDPR should not be confused with the notion of risk regulation, which is a “governmental interference with market or social processes to control potential adverse consequences”[16] and refers to how enforcement agencies prioritize action.\n\nPrinciples\nPersonal data may not be processed unless there is at least one legal basis to do so. Article 6 states the lawful purposes are:[17]\n\n(a) If the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data;\n(b) To fulfill contractual obligations with a data subject, or for tasks at the request of a data subject who is in the process of entering into a contract;\n(c) To comply with a data controller's legal obligations;\n(d) To protect the vital interests of a data subject or another individual;\n(e) To perform a task in the public interest or in official authority;\n(f) For the legitimate interests of a data controller or a third party, unless these interests are overridden by interests of the data subject or her or his rights according to the Charter of Fundamental Rights (especially in the case of children)[7]\nIf informed consent is used as the lawful basis for processing, consent must have been explicit for data collected and each purpose data is used for (Article 7; defined in Article 4).[18][19] Consent must be a specific, freely-given, plainly-worded, and unambiguous affirmation given by the data subject; an online form which has consent options structured as an opt-out selected by default is a violation of the GDPR, as the consent is not unambiguously affirmed by the user. In addition, multiple types of processing may not be \"bundled\" together into a single affirmation prompt, as this is not specific to each use of data, and the individual permissions are not freely given. (Recital 32)\n\nData subjects must be allowed to withdraw this consent at any time, and the process of doing so must not be harder than it was to opt in. (Article 7(3)) A data controller may not refuse service to users who decline consent to processing that is not strictly necessary in order to use the service. (Article 8) Consent for children, defined in the regulation as being less than 16 years old (although with the option for member states to individually make it as low as 13 years old (Article 8(1)), must be given by the child's parent or custodian, and verifiable (Article 8).[20][21]\n\nIf consent to processing was already provided under the Data Protection Directive, a data controller does not have to re-obtain consent if the processing is documented and obtained in compliance with the GDPR's requirements (Recital 171).[22][23]\n\nRights of the data subject\nTransparency and modalities\nArticle 12 requires that the data controller provides information to the \"data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child.\"[7]\n\nInformation and access\nThe right of access (Article 15) is a data subject right.[24] It gives people the right to access their personal data and information about how this personal data is being processed. A data controller must provide, upon request, an overview of the categories of data that are being processed (Article 15(1)(b)) as well as a copy of the actual data (Article 15(3)); furthermore, the data controller has to inform the data subject on details about the processing, such as the purposes of the processing (Article 15(1)(a)), with whom the data is shared (Article 15(1)(c)), and how it acquired the data (Article 15(1)(g)).\n\nA data subject must be able to transfer personal data from one electronic processing system to and into another, without being prevented from doing so by the data controller. Data that has been sufficiently anonymised is excluded, but data that has been only de-identified but remains possible to link to the individual in question, such as by providing the relevant identifier, is not.[25] In practice, however, providing such identifiers can be challenging, such as in the case of Apple's Siri, where voice and transcript data is stored with a personal identifier that the manufacturer restricts access to,[26] or in online behavioural targeting, which relies heavily on device fingerprints that can be challenging to capture, send, and verify.[27]\n\nBoth data being 'provided' by the data subject and data being 'observed', such as about behaviour, are included. In addition, the data must be provided by the controller in a structured and commonly used standard electronic format. The right to data portability is provided by Article 20 of the GDPR.[28]\n\nRectification and erasure\nA right to be forgotten was replaced by a more limited right of erasure in the version of the GDPR that was adopted by the European Parliament in March 2014.[29][30] Article 17 provides that the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to them on any one of a number of grounds within 30 days, including noncompliance with Article 6(1) (lawfulness) that includes a case (f) if the legitimate interests of the controller are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require protection of personal data (see also Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, Mario Costeja González).[7]\n\nRight to object and automated decisions\nArticle 21 of the GDPR allows an individual to object to processing personal information for marketing or non-service related purposes.[31] This means the data controller must allow an individual the right to stop or prevent controller from processing their personal data.\n\nThere are some instances where this objection does not apply. For example, if:\n\nLegal or official authority is being carried out\n\"Legitimate interest\", where the organisation needs to process data in order to provide the data subject with a service they signed up for\nA task being carried out for public interest.\nGDPR is also clear that the data controller must inform individuals of their right to object from the first communication the controller has with them. This should be clear and separate from any other information the controller is providing and give them their options for how best to object to the processing of their data.\n\nThere are instances the controller can refuse a request, in the circumstances that the objection request is \"manifestly unfounded\" or \"excessive\", so each case of objection must be looked at individually.[31] Other countries such as Canada [32] are also, following the GDPR, considering legislation to regulate automated decision making under privacy laws, even though there are policy questions as to whether this is the best way to regulate AI.[citation needed]\n\nController and processor\nData controllers must clearly disclose any data collection, declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing, and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA. Firms have the obligation to protect data of employees and consumers to the degree where only the necessary data is extracted with minimum interference with data privacy from employees, consumers, or third parties. Firms should have internal controls and regulations for various departments such as audit, internal controls, and operations. Data subjects have the right to request a portable copy of the data collected by a controller in a common format, as well as the right to have their data erased under certain circumstances. Public authorities, and businesses whose core activities consist of regular or systematic processing of personal data, are required to employ a data protection officer (DPO), who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR. Businesses must report data breaches to national supervisory authorities within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In some cases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater.\n\nTo be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the data controller must implement measures that meet the principles of data protection by design and by default. Article 25 requires data protection measures to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Such measures include pseudonymising personal data, by the controller, as soon as possible (Recital 78). It is the responsibility and the liability of the data controller to implement effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities even if the processing is carried out by a data processor on behalf of the controller (Recital 74).[7] When data is collected, data subjects must be clearly informed about the extent of data collection, the legal basis for the processing of personal data, how long data is retained, if data is being transferred to a third-party and/or outside the EU, and any automated decision-making that is made on a solely algorithmic basis. Data subjects must be informed of their privacy rights under the GDPR, including their right to revoke consent to data processing at any time, their right to view their personal data and access an overview of how it is being processed, their right to obtain a portable copy of the stored data, their right to erasure of their data under certain circumstances, their right to contest any automated decision-making that was made on a solely algorithmic basis, and their right to file complaints with a Data Protection Authority. As such, the data subject must also be provided with contact details for the data controller and their designated data protection officer, where applicable.[33][34]\n\nData protection impact assessments (Article 35) have to be conducted when specific risks occur to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Risk assessment and mitigation is required and prior approval of the data protection authorities is required for high risks.\n\nArticle 25 requires data protection to be designed into the development of business processes for products and services. Privacy settings must therefore be set at a high level by default, and technical and procedural measures should be taken by the controller to make sure that the processing, throughout the whole processing lifecycle, complies with the regulation. Controllers should also implement mechanisms to ensure that personal data is not processed unless necessary for each specific purpose.\n\nA report[35] by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security elaborates on what needs to be done to achieve privacy and data protection by default. It specifies that encryption and decryption operations must be carried out locally, not by remote service, because both keys and data must remain in the power of the data owner if any privacy is to be achieved. The report specifies that outsourced data storage on remote clouds is practical and relatively safe if only the data owner, not the cloud service, holds the decryption keys.\n\nPseudonymisation\nAccording to the GDPR, pseudonymisation is a required process for stored data that transforms personal data in such a way that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information (as an alternative to the other option of complete data anonymisation).[36] An example is encryption, which renders the original data unintelligible in a process that cannot be reversed without access to the correct decryption key. The GDPR requires for the additional information (such as the decryption key) to be kept separately from the pseudonymised data.\n\nAnother example of pseudonymisation is tokenisation, which is a non-mathematical approach to protecting data at rest that replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes, referred to as tokens. While the tokens have no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value, they allow for specific data to be fully or partially visible for processing and analytics while sensitive information is kept hidden. Tokenisation does not alter the type or length of data, which means it can be processed by legacy systems such as databases that may be sensitive to data length and type. This also requires much fewer computational resources to process and less storage space in databases than traditionally-encrypted data.\n\nPseudonymisation is a privacy-enhancing technology and is recommended to reduce the risks to the concerned data subjects and also to help controllers and processors to meet their data protection obligations (Recital 28).[37]\n\nRecords of processing activities\nAccording to Article 30,[7] records of processing activities have to be maintained by each organisation matching one of following criteria:\n\nemploying more than 250 people;\nthe processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects;\nthe processing is not occasional;\nprocessing includes special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.\nSuch requirements may be modified by each EU country. The records shall be in electronic form and the controller or the processor and, where applicable, the controller's or the processor's representative, shall make the record available to the supervisory authority on request.\n\nRecords of controller shall contain all of the following information:\n\nthe name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint controller, the controller's representative and the data protection officer;\nthe purposes of the processing;\na description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data;\nthe categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed including recipients in third countries or international organisations;\nwhere applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including the identification of that third country or international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;\nwhere possible, the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different categories of data\nwhere possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1).\nRecords of processor shall contain all of the following information:\n\nthe name and contact details of the processor or processors and of each controller on behalf of which the processor is acting, and, where applicable, of the controller's or the processor's representative, and the data protection officer;\nthe categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller;\nwhere applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including the identification of that third country or international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the\ndocumentation of suitable safeguards;\nwhere possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1).[7]\nSecurity of personal data\nControllers and processors of personal data must put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using pseudonymization or full anonymization where appropriate). Data controllers must design information systems with privacy in mind. For instance, using the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the datasets are not publicly available by default and cannot be used to identify a subject. No personal data may be processed unless this processing is done under one of the six lawful bases specified by the regulation (consent, contract, public task, vital interest, legitimate interest or legal requirement). When the processing is based on consent the data subject has the right to revoke it at any time.\n\nArticle 33 states the data controller is under a legal obligation to notify the supervisory authority without undue delay unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the individuals. There is a maximum of 72 hours after becoming aware of the data breach to make the report. Individuals have to be notified if a high risk of an adverse impact is determined (Article 34). In addition, the data processor will have to notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach (Article 33). However, the notice to data subjects is not required if the data controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption (Article 34).[7]\n\nData protection officer\nSee also: European Commission Data Protection Officer\nArticle 37 requires appointment of a data protection officer. If processing is carried out by a public authority (except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting in their judicial capacity), or if processing operations involve regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, or if processing on a large scale of special categories of data and personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences (Articles 9 and Article 10,[38]) a data protection officer (DPO)—a person with expert knowledge of data protection law and practices—must be designated to assist the controller or processor in monitoring their internal compliance with the Regulation.[7]\n\nA designated DPO can be a current member of staff of a controller or processor, or the role can be outsourced to an external person or agency through a service contract. In any case, the processing body must make sure that there is no conflict of interest in other roles or interests that a DPO may hold. The contact details for the DPO must be published by the processing organisation (for example, in a privacy notice) and registered with the supervisory authority.\n\nThe DPO is similar to a compliance officer and is also expected to be proficient at managing IT processes, data security (including dealing with cyberattacks) and other critical business continuity issues associated with the holding and processing of personal and sensitive data. The skill set required stretches beyond understanding legal compliance with data protection laws and regulations. The DPO must maintain a living data inventory of all data collected and stored on behalf of the organization.[39] More details on the function and the role of data protection officer were given on 13 December 2016 (revised 5 April 2017) in a guideline document.[40]\n\nOrganisations based outside the EU must also appoint an EU-based person as a representative and point of contact for their GDPR obligations (Article 27). This is a distinct role from a DPO, although there is overlap in responsibilities that suggest that this role can also be held by the designated DPO.[41]\n\nRemedies, liability and penalties\nSee also: GDPR fines and notices\nBesides the definitions as a criminal offence according to national law following Article 83 GDPR the following sanctions can be imposed:\n\na warning in writing in cases of first and non-intentional noncompliance\nregular periodic data protection audits\na fine up to €10 million or up to 2% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater, if there has been an infringement of the following provisions: (Article 83, Paragraph 4[42])\nthe obligations of the controller and the processor pursuant to Articles 8, 11, 25 to 39, and 42 and 43\nthe obligations of the certification body pursuant to Articles 42 and 43\nthe obligations of the monitoring body pursuant to Article 41(4)\na fine up to €20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater, if there has been an infringement of the following provisions: (Article 83, Paragraph 5 & 6[42])\nthe basic principles for processing, including conditions for consent, pursuant to Articles 5, 6, 7, and 9\nthe data subjects' rights pursuant to Articles 12 to 22\nthe transfers of personal data to a recipient in a third country or an international organisation pursuant to Articles 44 to 49\nany obligations pursuant to member state law adopted under Chapter IX\nnoncompliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or the suspension of data flows by the supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(2) or failure to provide access in violation of Article 58(1)[7]\nExemptions\nThese are some cases which are not addressed in the GDPR specifically, thus are treated as exemptions.[43]\n\nPersonal or household activities\nLaw enforcement\nNational security[7]\nWhen the GDPR was being created, it was strictly created for the regulation of personal data which goes into the hands of companies. What is not covered by the GDPR is non-commercial information or household activities.[44] An example of these household activities may be emails between two high school friends.\n\nConversely, an entity or more precisely an \"enterprise\" has to be engaged in \"economic activity\" to be covered by the GDPR.[a] Economic activity is defined broadly under European Union competition law.[45]\n\nApplicability outside of the European Union\nThe GDPR also applies to data controllers and processors outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) if they are engaged in the \"offering of goods or services\" (regardless of whether a payment is required) to data subjects within the EEA, or are monitoring the behaviour of data subjects within the EEA (Article 3(2)). The regulation applies regardless of where the processing takes place.[46] This has been interpreted as intentionally giving GDPR extraterritorial jurisdiction for non-EU establishments if they are doing business with people located in the EU.[47]\n\nEU Representative\nUnder Article 27, non-EU establishments subject to GDPR are obliged to have a designee within the European Union, an \"EU Representative\", to serve as a point of contact for their obligations under the regulation. The EU Representative is the Controller's or Processor's contact person vis-à-vis European privacy supervisors and data subjects, in all matters relating to processing, to ensure compliance with this GDPR. A natural (individual) or moral (corporation) person can play the role of an EU Representative.[48] The non-EU establishment must issue a duly signed document (letter of accreditation) designating a given individual or company as its EU Representative. The said designation can only be given in writing.[49]\n\nAn establishment's failure to designate an EU Representative is considered ignorance of the regulation and relevant obligations, which itself is a violation of the GDPR subject to fines of up to €10 million or up to 2% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater. The intentional or negligent (willful blindness) character of the infringement (failure to designate an EU Representative) may rather constitute aggravating factors.[50]\n\nAn establishment does not need to name an EU Representative if they only engage in occasional processing that does not include, on a large scale, processing of special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) of GDPR or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10, and such processing is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes of the processing.[7] Non-EU public authorities and bodies are equally exempted.[51]\n\nThird countries\nChapter V of the GDPR forbids the transfer of the personal data of EU data subjects to countries outside of the EEA — known as third countries — unless appropriate safeguards are imposed, or the third country's data protection regulations are formally considered adequate by the European Commission (Article 45).[52][53] Binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses for data protection issued by a Data Processing Agreement (DPA), or a scheme of binding and enforceable commitments by the data controller or processor situated in a third country, are among examples.[54]\n\nUnited Kingdom implementation\nExplanation of the possible results from UK's divergence from the European GDPR[55]\nThe applicability of GDPR in the United Kingdom is affected by Brexit. Although the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union on 31 January 2020, it remained subject to EU law, including GDPR, until the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020.[52] The United Kingdom granted royal assent to the Data Protection Act 2018 on 23 May 2018, which augmented the GDPR, including aspects of the regulation that are to be determined by national law, and criminal offences for knowingly or recklessly obtaining, redistributing, or retaining personal data without the consent of the data controller.[56][57]\n\nUnder the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, existing and relevant EU law was transposed into local law upon completion of the transition, and the GDPR was amended by statutory instrument to remove certain provisions no longer needed due to the UK's non-membership in the EU. Thereafter, the regulation will be referred to as \"UK GDPR\".[58][53][52] The UK will not restrict the transfer of personal data to countries within the EEA under UK GDPR. However, the UK will become a third country under the EU GDPR, meaning that personal data may not be transferred to the country unless appropriate safeguards are imposed, or the European Commission performs an adequacy decision on the suitability of British data protection legislation (Chapter V). As part of the withdrawal agreement, the European Commission committed to perform an adequacy assessment.[52][53]\n\nIn April 2019, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) issued a proposed code of practice for social networking services when used by minors, enforceable under GDPR, which also includes restrictions on \"like\" and \"streak\" mechanisms in order to discourage social media addiction and on the use of this data for processing interests.[59][60]\n\nIn March 2021, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Oliver Dowden stated that the UK was exploring divergence from the EU GDPR in order to \"[focus] more on the outcomes that we want to have and less on the burdens of the rules imposed on individual businesses\".[61]\n\nReception\nAs per a study conducted by Deloitte in 2018, 92% of companies believe they are able to comply with GDPR in their business practices in the long run.[62]\n\nCompanies operating outside of the EU have invested heavily to align their business practices with GDPR. The area of GDPR consent has a number of implications for businesses who record calls as a matter of practice. A typical disclaimer is not considered sufficient to gain assumed consent to record calls. Additionally, when recording has commenced, should the caller withdraw their consent, then the agent receiving the call must be able to stop a previously started recording and ensure the recording does not get stored.[63]\n\nIT professionals expect that compliance with the GDPR will require additional investment overall: over 80 percent of those surveyed expected GDPR-related spending to be at least US$100,000.[64] The concerns were echoed in a report commissioned by the law firm Baker & McKenzie that found that \"around 70 percent of respondents believe that organizations will need to invest additional budget/effort to comply with the consent, data mapping and cross-border data transfer requirements under the GDPR.\"[65] The total cost for EU companies is estimated at around €200 billion while for US companies the estimate is for $41.7 billion.[66] It has been argued that smaller businesses and startup companies might not have the financial resources to adequately comply with the GDPR, unlike the larger international technology firms (such as Facebook and Google) that the regulation is ostensibly meant to target first and foremost.[67][68] A lack of knowledge and understanding of the regulations has also been a concern in the lead-up to its adoption.[69] A counter-argument to this has been that companies were made aware of these changes two years prior to them coming into effect and should have had enough time to prepare.[70]\n\nThe regulations, including whether an enterprise must have a data protection officer, have been criticized for potential administrative burden and unclear compliance requirements.[71] Although data minimisation is a requirement, with pseudonymisation being one of the possible means, the regulation provide no guidance on how or what constitutes an effective data de-identification scheme, with a grey area on what would be considered as inadequate pseudonymisation subject to Section 5 enforcement actions.[72][73][74] There is also concern regarding the implementation of the GDPR in blockchain systems, as the transparent and fixed record of blockchain transactions contradicts the very nature of the GDPR.[75] Many media outlets have commented on the introduction of a \"right to explanation\" of algorithmic decisions,[76][77] but legal scholars have since argued that the existence of such a right is highly unclear without judicial tests and is limited at best.[78][79]\n\nThe GDPR has garnered support from businesses who regard it as an opportunity to improve their data management.[80][81] Mark Zuckerberg has also called it a \"very positive for the Internet\",[82] and has called for GDPR-style laws to be adopted in the US.[83] Consumer rights groups such as The European Consumer Organisation are among the most vocal proponents of the legislation.[84] Other supporters have attributed its passage to the whistleblower Edward Snowden.[85] Free software advocate Richard Stallman has praised some aspects of the GDPR but called for additional safeguards to prevent technology companies from \"manufacturing consent\".[86]\n\nImpact\nAcademic experts who participated in the formulation of the GDPR wrote that the law \"is the most consequential regulatory development in information policy in a generation. The GDPR brings personal data into a complex and protective regulatory regime.\"\n\nDespite having had at least two years to prepare and do so, many companies and websites changed their privacy policies and features worldwide directly prior to GDPR's implementation, and customarily provided email and other notifications discussing these changes. This was criticised for resulting in a fatiguing number of communications, while experts noted that some reminder emails incorrectly asserted that new consent for data processing had to be obtained for when the GDPR took effect (any previously-obtained consent to processing is valid as long as it met the regulation's requirements). Phishing scams also emerged using falsified versions of GDPR-related emails, and it was also argued that some GDPR notice emails may have actually been sent in violation of anti-spam laws.[87][22] In March 2019, a provider of compliance software found that many websites operated by EU member state governments contained embedded tracking from ad technology providers.[88][89]\n\nThe deluge of GDPR-related notices also inspired memes, including those surrounding privacy policy notices being delivered by atypical means (such as an Ouija board or Star Wars opening crawl), suggesting that Santa Claus's \"naughty or nice\" list was a violation, and a recording of excerpts from the regulation by a former BBC Radio 4 Shipping Forecast announcer. A blog, GDPR Hall of Shame, was also created to showcase unusual delivery of GDPR notices, and attempts at compliance that contained egregious violations of the regulation's requirements. Its author remarked that the regulation \"has a lot of nitty gritty, in-the-weeds details, but not a lot of information about how to comply\", but also acknowledged that businesses had two years to comply, making some of its responses unjustified.[90][91][92][93][94]\n\nResearch indicates that approximately 25% of software vulnerabilities have GDPR implications.[95] Since Article 33 emphasizes breaches, not bugs, security experts advise companies to invest in processes and capabilities to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, including coordinated vulnerability disclosure processes.[96][97] An investigation of Android apps' privacy policies, data access capabilities, and data access behaviour has shown that numerous apps display a somewhat privacy-friendlier behaviour since the GDPR was implemented, although they still retain most of their data access privileges in their code.[98][99] An investigation of the Consumer Council of Norway (called Forbrukerrådet in Norwegian) into the post-GDPR data subject dashboards on social media platforms (such as Google dashboard) has concluded that large social media firms deploy deceptive tactics in order to discourage their customers from sharpening their privacy settings.[100]\n\nOn the effective date, some websites began to block visitors from EU countries entirely (including Instapaper,[101] Unroll.me,[102] and Tribune Publishing-owned newspapers, such as the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times) or redirect them to stripped-down versions of their services (in the case of National Public Radio and USA Today) with limited functionality and/or no advertising so that they will not be liable.[103][104][105][106] Some companies, such as Klout, and several online video games, ceased operations entirely to coincide with its implementation, citing the GDPR as a burden on their continued operations, especially due to the business model of the former.[107][108][109] The volume of online behavioural advertising placements in Europe fell 25–40% on 25 May 2018.[110][111]\n\nIn 2020, two years after the GDPR began its implementation, the European Commission assessed that users across the EU had increased their knowledge about their rights, stating that \"69% of the population above the age of 16 in the EU have heard about the GDPR and 71% of people heard about their national data protection authority.\"[112][113] The commission also found that privacy has become a competitive quality for companies which consumers are taking into account in their decisionmaking processes.[112]\n\nEnforcement and inconsistency\nMain article: GDPR fines and notices\nFacebook and subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Google LLC (targeting Android), were immediately sued by Max Schrems's non-profit NOYB just hours after midnight on 25 May 2018, for their use of \"forced consent\". Schrems asserts that both companies violated Article 7(4) by not presenting opt-ins for data processing consent on an individualized basis, and requiring users to consent to all data processing activities (including those not strictly necessary) or would be forbidden from using the services.[114][115][116][117][118] On 21 January 2019, Google was fined €50 million by the French DPA for showing insufficient control, consent, and transparency over use of personal data for behavioural advertising.[119][120] In November 2018, following a journalistic investigation into Liviu Dragnea, the Romanian DPA (ANSPDCP) used a GDPR request to demand information on the RISE Project's sources.[121][122]\n\nIn July 2019, the British Information Commissioner's Office issued an intention to fine British Airways a record £183 million (1.5% of turnover) for poor security arrangements that enabled a 2018 web skimming attack affecting around 380,000 transactions.[123][124][125][126][127] British Airways was ultimately fined a reduced amount of £20m, with the ICO noting that they had \"considered both representations from BA and the economic impact of COVID-19 on their business before setting a final penalty\".[128]\n\nIn December 2019, Politico reported that Ireland and Luxembourg – two smaller EU countries that have had a reputation as a tax havens and (especially in the case of Ireland) as a base for European subsidiaries of U.S. big tech companies – were facing significant backlogs in their investigations of major foreign companies under GDPR, with Ireland citing the complexity of the regulation as a factor. Critics interviewed by Politico also argued that enforcement was also being hampered by varying interpretations between member states, the prioritisation of guidance over enforcement by some authorities, and a lack of cooperation between member states.[129]\n\nWhile companies are now subject to legal obligations, there are still various inconsistencies in the practical and technical implementation of GDPR.[130] As an example, according to the GDPR's right to access, the companies are obliged to provide data subjects with the data they gather about them. However, in a study on loyalty cards in Germany, companies did not provide the data subjects with the exact information of the purchased articles.[131] One might argue that such companies do not collect the information of the purchased articles, which does not conform with their business models. Therefore, data subjects tend to see that as a GDPR violation. As a result, studies have suggested for a better control through authorities.[131]\n\nAccording to the GDPR, end-users' consent should be valid, freely given, specific, informed and active.[132] However, the lack of enforceability regarding obtaining lawful consents has been a challenge. As an example, a 2020 study, showed that the Big Tech, i.e. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft (GAFAM), use dark patterns in their consent obtaining mechanisms, which raises doubts regarding the lawfulness of the acquired consent.[132]\n\nIn March 2021, EU member states led by France were reported to be attempting to modify the impact of the privacy regulation in Europe by exempting national security agencies.[133]\n\nAfter around 160 million Euros in GDPR fines were imposed in 2020, the figure was already over one billion Euros in 2021.[134]\n\nInfluence on foreign laws\nMass adoption of these new privacy standards by multinational companies has been cited as an example of the \"Brussels effect\", a phenomenon wherein European laws and regulations are used as a baseline due to their gravitas.[135]\n\nThe U.S. state of California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act on 28 June 2018, taking effect on 1 January 2020; it grants rights to transparency and control over the collection of personal information by companies in a similar means to GDPR. Critics have argued that such laws need to be implemented at the federal level to be effective, as a collection of state-level laws would have varying standards that would complicate compliance.[136][137][138] Two other U.S. states have since enacted similar legislation: Virginia passed the Consumer Data Privacy Act on 2 March 2021,[139] and Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act on 8 July 2021.[140]\n\nThe Republic of Turkey, a candidate for European Union membership, has adopted the Law on The Protection of Personal Data on 24 March 2016 in compliance with the EU acquis.[141]\n\nIn China, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), \"China's first comprehensive law designed to regulate online data and protect personal information\" came into force in 2021.[142]\n\nTimeline\n25 January 2012: The proposal for the GDPR was released.[10]\n21 October 2013: The European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) had its orientation vote.\n15 December 2015: Negotiations between the European Parliament, Council and Commission (Formal Trilogue meeting) resulted in a joint proposal.\n17 December 2015: The European Parliament's LIBE Committee voted for the negotiations between the three parties.\n8 April 2016: Adoption by the Council of the European Union.[143] The only member state voting against was Austria, which argued that the level of data protection in some respects falls short compared to the 1995 directive.[144][145]\n14 April 2016: Adoption by the European Parliament.[146]\n24 May 2016: The regulation entered into force, 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.[24]\n25 May 2018: Its provisions became directly applicable in all member states, two years after the regulations enter into force.[24]\n20 July 2018: the GDPR became valid in the EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway),[147] after the EEA Joint Committee and the three countries agreed to follow the regulation.[148]\nEU Digital Single Market\nThe EU Digital Single Market strategy relates to \"digital economy\" activities related to businesses and people in the EU.[149] As part of the strategy, the GDPR and the NIS Directive all apply from 25 May 2018. The proposed ePrivacy Regulation was also planned to be applicable from 25 May 2018, but will be delayed for several months.[150] The eIDAS Regulation is also part of the strategy.\n\nIn an initial assessment, the European Council has stated that the GDPR should be considered \"a prerequisite for the development of future digital policy initiatives\".[151]\n\nSee also\nflag\tEuropean Union portal\nicon\tLaw portal\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)\nChildren's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)\nPersonal Information Protection Law (PIPL) (China)\nConvention on Cybercrime\nData Governance Act, proposed EU law from 2020\nData portability\nDigital Markets Act\nDigital Services Act\nDo Not Track legislation\nePrivacy Regulation\nEU��US Privacy Shield\nEuropean Data Protection Board (EDPB)\nGeneral Personal Data Protection Law (LGPD)\nPrivacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002\nPrivacy Impact Assessment\nProtection of Personal Information Act (PoPIA) (South Africa)\nNotes\n Refer GDPR article 4(18): 'enterprise' means a natural or legal person engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form, including partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity.[7]\nCitations\n \"Presidency of the Council: 'Compromise text.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "INTRODUCTION\nWith a growing suite of advancing and emerging technologies coming together in all areas of our economy, the need to make sense of disparate data has never been greater. The convergence of autonomous vehicles, drones and bots, IoT sensors, XR, sovereign identity, digital transactions, 5G, and the need for an artificial intelligence system that can safely orchestrate all their activities necessitates new technologies and protocols.  An integrated operational framework and system is needed to contextualize, synchronize and make interoperable these disparate data sources about people, places, assets and vehicles.\nTHE COMPANY\nVERSES provides a next-generation AI-based contextual computing operating system based on the Spatial Web standards (see below and IEEE WG P2874).  The most urgent and difficult problem in computing is poor interoperability between software and hardware. It is necessary to integrate these disparate but increasingly mutually reliant technologies into a unified and cohesive network for an information exchange that is as coherent with our logical understanding of the world as it is with the physical features of the world. There are four main challenges:\nThe context challenge of inter-networking functionalities and data between humans, machines, as well as objects, and the heterogeneous and siloed systems operating them.\nThe spatial challenge of delineating and coordinating the activities between humans, machines, and objects in a multidimensional way (3D, 4D, cost, temp, safety etc…).\nThe operational challenge of synchronizing the flow of information and activities across spaces, humans, machines, and objects.\nThe legislative challenge of creating and maintaining digital versions of policies and legislations and making them machine-readable, machine sharable and machine-executable.\n\nNEW SPATIAL WEB STANDARDS \nThe above challenges (contextual, spatial, operational and legislative) can be properly addressed using a new standard protocol that allows people, places and things to communicate: (1) a common language that models spatial or hyperdimensional relationships, and (2) a contracting protocol that queries that language and sends and receives the common language’s data.  These standards have been developed by the Spatial Web Foundation and are in the course of being standardized within the IEEE WG P2874, namely: \nHSML - Hyperspace Modeling Language\nA common data model that enables adaptive intelligence at scale.\nA standard that articulates the types of relationships which can exist between any base elements and their purpose.\nHSTP - Hyperspace Transaction Protocol\nMulti-dimensional range query.\nGoverns interactions between parties to ensure privacy and security.\nThe IEEE considers HSML and HSTP a “Public Imperative”, a designation typically reserved for critical public infrastructure like nuclear energy, smart grids, and voting machines.\nA unified operating system, developed by VERSES, was built upon HSML and HSTP. It allows for the deployment of artificial intelligence applications in a way that addresses the contextual, spatial, and operational challenges.\nTHE CONTEXT CHALLENGE > CONTEXT AUGMENTS DATA FOR AIs\nThe world is overflowing with data, yet AI seems to be hitting a glass ceiling in terms of performance, relevance and explainability. This issue can be summarized as a challenge in context-making. Data is currently out of context, and it needs to be put into context. “Context” in this instance is the semantic, societal, situational, and environmental meta-data model about the activities of people, places and things over time. Context needs to be shared between networks of heterogeneous devices and applications empowering them to proactively offer enriched, situation-aware and usable content, instructions and experiences.\nContext is made up of the elements of relationships that define the entities, objects, locations and actions—commonly known as the Who, What, When, Where, How and Why of any scenario, contract or circumstance. The Spatial Web Foundation defined a context graph (HSML—see also below) that describes the relationships between these different context elements. In turn, the context-aware computing developed by VERSES (COSM operating system) enables increasing degrees of insight from the contextualized data. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPATIAL CHALLENGE > SPATIAL DOMAINS AUGMENT DIGITAL TWINS\n\n3.1. Spatial Domains\nSpatial Domains are digital titles linked to 3D volumetric locations such as buildings, ports, streets, or larger regions, such as cities, states, continents and trading blocs. Spatial subdomains represent subspaces that have a holonic structure, which allows for the orchestration of hierarchical rights and policies.\nSpatial domains enable secure management of digitally mediated rights and permissions for:\nWho/what is authorized to access the domain.\nWhat content or data is available to view.\nWho can publish and modify content.\nWho can transact or interact with it.\n\nOne key piece of information maintained by the spatial domain is the 3D model itself.  This 3D model contains all the geometries, addresses, appropriate routes, location of IoT devices, and any subdomains.  The 3D model is dynamic and can be updated in real-time as local conditions change.\nSpatial Domains contain all the rules, rights, permissions, fees, 3D models, IoT devices, network access, etc. associated with a geospatial region as defined by their owner or authority. This results in a governance layer of geospatial information written in HSML that can be queried by agents as they approach and move through them. They also can be queried remotely, allowing AIs to assist in deciding the optimal route or best way to complete operations and transactions based on the domain's restrictions.\nSpatial domains use a holonic architecture, i.e., nested spatial domains, or holons, that inherit the rules above them and pass their rules to the ones below them.  For example, federal laws are usually applicable to states or provinces, however the local authorities will apply their own local ordinances as well. \n3.2. Spatial or Multidimensional Range Queries \nIn order for autonomous drones and vehicles to operate, and for AI to orchestrate their activities, a query method is required to gather all the data necessary from disparate sources; we call this system the Spatial DNS (sDNS).  \nSpatial DNS (nDimensional Range Query) & HSTP \nThe sDNS allows actors to request information via HSTP (Hyperspatial Transaction Protocol), such as:\nWhere can I go?\nHow should I go there?\nWhat can I do?\nWhat credentials do I need?\nWhat are the weather conditions there?\nWhat are the costs?\nH3 Geospatial Index\nTo query spatial domains, the actor or agent defines the geospatial area of interest using a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) called H3.  H3 allows for any geospatial shape to be queried on earth, resulting in an index of associated domains with very little latency.  These domains then can be queried further to discover their rules or data needed to carry out an operation. \n\nTHE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGE > COSM, AN AI-BASED CONTEXT COMPUTING PLATFORM\n4.1. Context Awareness\nVERSES’ flagship offering, COSM™ (Context-aware Open Service Mesh), is an Artificial Intelligence Operating System built upon the open protocols HSML and HSTP for managing resources and deploying AI applications on the Spatial Web. Its five Flow Modules are designed to address the requirements for a universal network of humans, machines, and AI. COSM™ contextualizes spatial relationships according to Spatial Domains through a Spatial Domain Name Service (SDNS) that organizes and allows for the management of policies and permissions.\nCOSM™ addresses the above requirements:\nIO-Flow (Communication): Interface agent. Management of connected devices to publish sensor data and instruct machines and humans to perform tasks.\nData-Flow (Interoperability): Context mapping. Normalization and correlation of data from disparate systems into a unified coherent HSML Context Graph™.\nDomain-Flow (Trust): Rule configuration. Definition of the policies, permissions, and credentials that govern the interactions of all actors on the Spatial Web.\nSim-Flow (Adaptability): Goal simulation. Simulation of goal-based optimizations based on requirements or restrictions, and recommendation of tasks to achieve ideal states.\nWork-Flow (Execution): Task engine. Delegation of optimization tasks to a connected workforce of humans, autonomous vehicles, and/or bots.  \nAll data coming from and to the IoT sensors will be converted into HSML the lingua franca of the digital twin, normalizing all its information. HSML is the language of the actor and its twin; it describes all operations and activities within either a COSM operating system or other OS utilizing HSML.\nUsing COSM offers the following capabilities:\nNew data meta-models and communication protocols that define a common method to describe, express, share, and update context between all the edges of a network. Context in this instance is the semantic, societal, situational, and environmental meta-data model about people, places, and things over time.\nContext is shared between networks of heterogeneous devices and applications, empowering them to proactively offer enriched, situation-aware, and usable content, instructions and experiences—like a situational communal garden of context information if you will.\nCOSM allows context to:\nBe stateful.\nBe machine-readable and executable.\nBe shareable between heterogeneous networks, devices and applications.\nMaintain coherence over time and space for all the actors/edges involved in a use case.\nThese new meta-models support context-aware applications that, in turn, are able to support interoperable, cross-platform networking between disparate hardware (e.g., autonomous drones, sensors, smart devices, robots) and software systems (e.g., enterprise services, cloud platforms, mobile applications, artificial intelligence) across different vendors and suppliers.\nThe challenges in modeling context are linked to—and not limited to—a set of constraints: they need to represent the relationship between the identity of the actor, the scope and authorization of his permissioned activities, and the place and time where they may happen. COSM coherently describes and maintains the where and when of any scenario (dimensions, space, time and channel), the why and how (i.e., conditions or governance—right, credential, claim and activity), and the who and what—i.e., objects—authority, domain, actor and asset).\nCOSM allows to orchestrate AIs that run on the same coherent context model, therefore compounding/allowing AIs to compete on the same data formats, in order to derive more relevant, more accurate, and more explainable simulations and recommendations.\nCOSM’s distributed holonic architecture enables AIs designed for specific optimized functions. It does so by ingesting and sharing data with other micro- & macro-COSMs above and below it, therefore providing the specific curated and normalized data required to efficiently perform their function. This type of holonic structure mirrors the neural network of the brain.   \nVERSES’ TIPS (Trust, Interoperability, Privacy, and Security) framework allows for the secure and privacy-preserving governance of people, places and things. This is not possible without having a network that is context-aware.\n\n4.2. Autonomous interoperability and internetworking edges\nAll autonomous actors on the network need to be aware of the other actors, their route, tasks, credentials, capabilities, sensors, etc.  This will enable actors to coordinate activities, work as swarms, alert each other to danger, and even share their sensor data with others on the network.  \nIn order to reach L5 autonomous driving, an interoperability system such as this needs to exist.  Without this capability all these actors will operate as independent nodes, working on their own without awareness or coordination of the others, which is the current state of autonomous vehicles.  \nVehicle capabilities\nA profile of the vehicle or drone and all its capabilities and limitations needs to be known in order for the system to assign the most optimal and safe route and coordinate its activities with other actors.  For example, how fast can a drone safely operate, under what weather conditions and carrying how much weight?\n\nVehicle digital twin\nEach vehicle is represented as a digital twin, cataloging and registering its many sensors into a single model.  This will allow the vehicle to act as a single organism, fusing all its sensors together.  The digital twin will allow for its authority to access and control all aspects of its sensors.  When a new IoT sensor is introduced to the vehicle, say a phone or a new camera, the vehicle’s actor detects its presence VIA bluetooth, and inspects its smart wallet to determine its credentials, capabilities, network and power requirements.  If the authority grants it access, it registers it into the digital twin and adds it to the sensor fusion model.  \n\nTHE POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE CHALLENGE > HOW TO MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE POLICIES THAT CAN BE INTERPRETED AND SHARED BY MACHINES AND HUMANS\n5.1. From analog policies to digital law\nExisting regulation has been drafted traditionally by humans and for humans, but with little regard for interpretability and  executability by a machine. There is tremendous value in seeking to bridge the gap between the traditional way of drafting and publishing regulation (i.e., by humans for humans) and having machine-readable and machine-executable regulation (i.e., by humans, for machines) especially in the context of autonomous mobility scenarios.\nTranslating existing regulation into machine-interpretable  and machine-executable code will allow us to properly capture how humans read and interpret the regulation,  and, when technology fails to do so, to develop an alternative that is technically feasible and can be acceptable for human  regulators. More generally, the challenge is to discover where and why technology can replace humans when it comes to interpretation, and where and why not.\nFurthermore, harmonized liability rules (for drones for example) are lacking at the EU level. Consequently, liability law is governed by the  traditional rules at the national (Member State) level. An innovation, therefore, lies in (1) the development of liability rules that are  (2) machine-interpretable and machine-executable. Finally, regulation is subject to change, and it is often multi-layered, meaning  that regulatory bodies at different levels (e.g., EU level, state level, municipality level, company level) jointly contribute to a specific  type of regulation. As a result, different pieces of regulation may consist of different languages. To make a regulation machine interpretable and machine-executable, and to make any interpretation model scalable, a semantic representation needs to be  available that accommodates regulatory changes and regulation at different levels and in different languages. The technological  challenge lies in developing a suitable semantic representation.\nVERSES developed automated tools with COSM and HSML for governing actions within the domain of Urban Air Mobility to enforce rules and policies systematically. Our solution allows current laws to be parsed into machine-readable models and interpreted programmatically, reducing the human interpretation of laws and guidelines into more binary statements. Our developed technology takes the legal text and constructs ontologies and context from automated Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methodologies. These are then used to construct machine-readable representations of specific legal scenarios. This information is then parsed into HSML, where it is combined with other sources of information (such as IoT devices, user input, cameras, drones, etc.).\nSeveral laws that have been converted into HSML have been tested in real-world flight environments, including rules about dynamically changing variables. We translated existing EU laws for Urban Air Mobility into HSML, ensuring that the proposed actions and flight plans automatically conform to the set of parsed rules and regulations at play:\nWe ensured that HSML could accommodate the vast array of prohibitive and deontic laws found in the EU literature.\nWe worked with legal experts to ensure that the assumptions made during the translation process abide by existing interpretations of the relevant laws.\nWe worked to provide a mechanism for suggesting legal innovations when a machine-readable format cannot straightforwardly accommodate the ambiguity of laws.\n5.2. Promises and challenges\nHSML allows the evaluation of  counterfactual actions - what would happen if someone were to perform a certain activity? We can use this to perform (abstract) routing - find (optimal) series of legal activities that get from HSML graph A to HSML graph B\nHSML is updated from a range of real-time data sources; it allows autonomous agents to dynamically operate within the confines of the law. If there is a law about maximum wind speed, and dynamically update the route given changing wind-speed conditions\nHSML can be extended beyond laws - any “rules of the games” can be constructed and abided by using the same schemas and systems\nThe law is inherently ambiguous and generally applied to humans (“UA operators must fly safely” - how do you define “safely”? Can AI operate safer than humans?). HSML can help automatically identify ambiguous laws and can provide a feedback mechanism for developing future analog laws with machine readability in mind. This can be the foundation for a virtuous two-way loop between analog law and digital law.\n\nA multi-sensor, AI-observed and operated transportation system would be able to analyze and measure the effectiveness and downsides of current legislation and infrastructure.  By modeling the existing laws and infrastructure, AI can run virtually infinite simulations, determining the optimal balance of efficiency and risk and thereby providing recommendations to legislators how best to adjust the laws and infrastructure in the real world.\nFLYING FORWARD 2020\n\nFlying Forward 2020: supporting the future of UAM with COSM’s geospatial governance capabilities and sensor fusion\nFlying Forward is a 3-year collaborative research project to develop a new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) ecosystem by incorporating UAM within a geospatial data infrastructure of cities. COSM is at the heart of that new infrastructure. COSM uses sensor fusion to provide the capabilities to govern the behavior of autonomous drones flying in urban areas. That involves integrating legal and spatial policies in the simulation and activation of the scenarios, while for example allowing for dynamic (re)routing, multi-party interoperability and managing landing zones.\nThe FF2020 demonstrators cover 5 use cases :\nSecurity and surveillance\nInfrastructure inspection\nAsset deliveries\nCrowd management\nEmergency deliveries.\n\nIn these scenarios, VERSES goes beyond Device Identification and Profile Authentication to make devices become Policy-aware and Location-aware. As a result, physical activities of IoT devices can be governed and enforceable at the hardware level.\nCOSM can, for example, create and manage flight corridors and no-fly zones across the city and around buildings, delivering everything from humans, packaging and surveillance. Other capabilities include Geofencing, waypoints planning, dynamic routing, object/people detection, video streaming, missions management, portal and app solution, human control, and much more.\nCOSM allows interoperability between all the edges and systems involved in the use cases and in particular allows the behavior of an,y “thing” (drone, car, truck, vessel…) to be law-abiding and adaptive in real-time to policy changes and updates\n\n\nMOBILITY USE CASES\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of examples VERSES and the Spatial Web are exploring with industry leaders and regulators.\n\nCommon shared understanding of the world\nWe believe that regulators and transportation authorities should assist in the creation of a global transportation digital twin, comprising all the local laws and rules digitally represented, machine-readable and queryable using spatial DNS (sDNS).\nCurrently, every car company must research, build and maintain their own model of the world’s laws and rules.  This is a huge expense and liability to the company and greatly hinders advancement as well as serving as a significant barrier to entry for startups.  Furthermore, since each company has their own siloed view of the world, true interoperability and shared understanding will never be possible and therefore L5 autonomy will be even more difficult to achieve.  \nSuch as system would enable independent simulators to have an accurate model of the world’s laws greatly increasing their efficacy.\nStreet sign database\nCurrently, vehicles can have a hard time recognizing the countless variations of international street signs.   A public and queryable database of all street signs and their meaning is needed to ensure safety. Furthermore, the spatial location of each sign and its jurisdiction needs to be registered so that ideally vehicles are aware of the rules of the road without the need to read the sign in the first place.\nCongestion, Routing, sequencing and optimization \nBy all actors anonymously sharing their routes and destinations, local and regional AI systems will be able to orchestrate their travel.  We envision this to be managed in a holonic method, organizing actors into groups of regional, city and local swarms.   First, the system would group an actor with other local actors into tight swarms of vehicles going in the same direction, splitting them off to join other swarms when needed to reach their destination.  Agents going cross town will be coordinated into trains of vehicles with gaps appropriately spaced to allow for other swarms to cross through them at intersections without having to come to a stop.  Swarms covering regional distances will be grouped into even larger swarms, acting like a bike peloton, reducing air friction and energy costs.  Vehicles can be moved through the swarm to mitigate their energy output, ensuring every vehicle can maximize its chance of reaching its destination without having to stop for recharging.  \nIntersections and air flight corridors\nAs vehicles approach highly congested road intersections or flight corridors, an AI for these spaces will be alerted of their presence and intention.  This hyper-localized AI will be responsible for the coordination and optimization of all vehicles in its domain as they traverse the space, effectively taking operational control until the vehicle is safely through the space whereby it will release control back to the agent and system to continue on its journey. \n\nEvery intersection and flight corridor is unique and has its own set of challenges and risks.  By modeling and analyzing the infrastructure, traffic flows and safety, the AI will be able to determine the optimal operational efficiency of each spatial domain and orchestrate all vehicles moving through it.  This is Urban Air planning and the foundation for augmenting Air Traffic Management solutions. \nCharging, energy and carbon reporting \nElectrical charging stations should report the associated carbon cost and help mitigate the cost with carbon offsets.  Energy used should be attributed to each actor and their route so the climate domain can get an accurate climate accounting of all transportation costs.   \nParking, landing zones and charging stations\nCars and drones looking for a place to park, land and re-charge will be able to query the network and find available space and services.  Depending on the settings of its authority it will decide the best place based on price, location and urgency.   All fees and transactions will be automatically managed by all the actor’s smart wallets, including the vehicle and space.  For example, the parking garage or charging station will have a smart wallet to facilitate all transactions.  See Smart Wallet below.  \nTransactions, fees, tolls, parking, charging\nTolls, fees, parking, charging costs, all these transactions should be seamless and frictionless, happening in the background and managed by a smart wallet.  Agents should be able to set their preferences, choosing to pay more for premium services or less if on a budget.  \nWeather and pollution\nIoT sensors already blanket urban spaces capturing atmospheric data.  Actors need to be able to access this data to be able to make decisions on hazards or weather conditions. \nConstruction\nMunicipalities publishing their construction schedules and IoT-enabled work crews will be able to update the network of all closed or reduced capacity areas, optimizing the rerouting or coordination of traffic as it moves through congested zones.  \nObstacle avoidance\nAutonomous vehicles will constantly be requesting the latest model of the local environment for the most up-to-date digital twin.  If it detects any new unexpected obstacles, like deer in the road, it will update the local digital twin of the environment and and alert all oncoming traffic of the new ephemeral risk.   When the deer finally moves on and is out of view, the passing cars will automatically update the local digital twin to its prior state.  \nBikes & scooters\nIn the future other modes of transportation like bikes, scooters and the like could be included in the network if their navigation system or the passenger’s smart app was registered as an actor in the system.   \nVehicles not on the system\nFor legacy cars not registered in the network, driving apps like Wayz or Google Maps could be utilized to register the car and its route, informing the driver of the optimal route and speed at which they should drive to keep pace with the swarm, timing all the lights and intersections and be altered to dangers.  The vehicle’s IoT sensors or cameras can still be registered and accessed by the system.   Other autonomous cars on the system would be aware of the unregistered car and its route, providing a little extra buffer to make allowances for the human operator.  \nCars completely off the network and not utilizing a driving app would be out on their own, but provided the driver was savvy they ought to be able to follow along with the swarm and stay in cadence.  Autonomous vehicles would be able to identify the car as out of network and make allowances to maintain safe travel.  \nMaaS \nWorking across local, regional, national and international levels, a MaaS network can see the entire transportation graph, query it, determine the optimal route, sequence and transportation mode, make reservations and facilitate it into a single transaction.  Cameras located on and inside the vehicle will be able to identify customers and passengers while protecting their identity us the TIPS (Trust, Interoperability, Privacy & Security) framework.  \nFirst responders and safety\nPolice and fire departments responding to emergencies will automatically be provided the right of way with the system prioritizing their route and pausing all other swarms and vehicles.  Swarms and vehicles will be routed around traffic stops, accidents, fires etc to ensure the flow of traffic ensues.  \nWhen accidents or fires are reported, the emergency response domain should be able anonymously to access any cameras or sensors in the vicinity to remotely get real-time information about the conditions and respond accordingly. \nWhen emergency calls for fires or accidents occur, a drone should be automatically dispatched to the scene, providing key live insights to first responders about the current situation, how to approach and whether it should they send for backup.  \nLighting\nAll lights on the network would be made aware of vehicles, bots and swarms, ensuring to keep their way properly lit at night and turned off to conserve energy when they are not.  Unregistered vehicles, bicycles, people etc can still activate the lights by means of motion detectors, computer vision and mobile apps.  \nEntertainment and marketing\nWhether riding with a friend or using a ride-sharing service, the system should anonymously recognize each individual and be able to seamlessly access their entertainment preferences, giving them direct access to their media accounts and applications.  \nRide-sharing services can provide discounted services in exchange for targeted marketing opportunities to their captive audiences.  \nInsurance\nWhen actors declare and register their route, it can be published to a real-time insurance market where insurance providers will be able to bid their services.  By utilizing anonymous certificates, actors will be able to share their risk profile and operating history without compromising their identity. Using a real-time insurance marketplace, actors will be able to select their preferred coverage based on price, local laws and service.   AI agents representing the vehicle's authority and the insurer will be able automatically to complete the transaction and ensure coverage. \n\nsDNS Public Utility\nWe consider the need for such a queryable spatial DNS (sDNS) to be a requirement for L5 autonomy.   The sDNS is a public imperative and should be run like a public utility, allowing for any certified actor to access the system, request the data needed to safely achieve their desired goals and anonymously report back to the system.  It should be overseen by an intenational standards body (such as the Spatial Web Foundation & IEEE) comprised of industry and government organizations with input from citizens and watchdogs.  It should strive for interoperablity so that all vehicles, anywhere in the world can safely and securely operate on it’s network.  As this network of vehicles, IoT devices, cameras and operators expands, it becomes a sprawling sensor fusion and data mesh, enabling actors, authorities and AI to access information privately and securely to more efficiently and safely manage operations across even greater heterogeneous data sources and industry domains. \nSUMMARY\n\nCOSM allows for systems to share a more complete and coherent understanding of activities and continuously self-optimize, there are several fundamental requirements that build upon each other:\nCommunication: a common query language in which to interface\nInteroperability: a common data model in which to map context\nTrust: verifiable data lineage, credentials, and governance\nAdaptability: flexible logic to simulate and adjust\nExecution: ability to orchestrate tasks and resources\n\nVERSES is a company that provides a next-generation AI-based contextual computing operating system based on the Spatial Web standards.

The convergence of autonomous vehicles, drones and bots, IoT sensors, XR, sovereign identity, digital transactions, 5G, and the need for an artificial intelligence system that can safely orchestrate all their activities necessitates new technologies and protocols.  An integrated operational framework and system is needed to contextualize, synchronize and make interoperable these disparate data sources about people, places, assets and vehicles.\nTHE COMPANY\nVERSES provides a next-generation AI-based contextual computing operating system based on the Spatial Web standards (see below and IEEE WG P2874).  The most urgent and difficult problem in computing is poor interoperability between software and hardware. It is necessary to integrate these disparate but increasingly mutually reliant technologies into a unified and cohesive network for an information exchange that is as coherent with our logical understanding of the world as it is with the physical features of the world. There are four main challenges:\nThe context challenge of inter-networking functionalities and data between humans, machines, as well as objects, and the heterogeneous and siloed systems operating them.\nThe spatial challenge of delineating and coordinating the activities between humans, machines, and objects in a multidimensional way (3D, 4D, cost, temp, safety etc…).\nThe operational challenge of synchronizing the flow of information and activities across spaces, humans, machines, and objects.\nThe legislative challenge of creating and maintaining digital versions of policies and legislations and making them machine-readable, machine sharable and machine-executable.\n\nNEW SPATIAL WEB STANDARDS \nThe above challenges (contextual, spatial, operational and legislative) can be properly addressed using a new standard protocol that allows people, places and things to communicate: (1) a common language that models spatial or hyperdimensional relationships, and (2) a contracting protocol that queries that language and sends and receives the common language’s data.  These standards have been developed by the Spatial Web Foundation and are in the course of being standardized within the IEEE WG P2874, namely: \nHSML - Hyperspace Modeling Language\nA common data model that enables adaptive intelligence at scale.\nA standard that articulates the types of relationships which can exist between any base elements and their purpose.\nHSTP - Hyperspace Transaction Protocol\nMulti-dimensional range query.\nGoverns interactions between parties to ensure privacy and security.\nThe IEEE considers HSML and HSTP a “Public Imperative”, a designation typically reserved for critical public infrastructure like nuclear energy, smart grids, and voting machines.\nA unified operating system, developed by VERSES, was built upon HSML and HSTP. It allows for the deployment of artificial intelligence applications in a way that addresses the contextual, spatial, and operational challenges.\nTHE CONTEXT CHALLENGE > CONTEXT AUGMENTS DATA FOR AIs\nThe world is overflowing with data, yet AI seems to be hitting a glass ceiling in terms of performance, relevance and explainability. This issue can be summarized as a challenge in context-making. Data is currently out of context, and it needs to be put into context. “Context” in this instance is the semantic, societal, situational, and environmental meta-data model about the activities of people, places and things over time. Context needs to be shared between networks of heterogeneous devices and applications empowering them to proactively offer enriched, situation-aware and usable content, instructions and experiences.\nContext is made up of the elements of relationships that define the entities, objects, locations and actions—commonly known as the Who, What, When, Where, How and Why of any scenario, contract or circumstance. The Spatial Web Foundation defined a context graph (HSML—see also below) that describes the relationships between these different context elements. In turn, the context-aware computing developed by VERSES (COSM operating system) enables increasing degrees of insight from the contextualized data. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPATIAL CHALLENGE > SPATIAL DOMAINS AUGMENT DIGITAL TWINS\n\n3.1. Spatial Domains\nSpatial Domains are digital titles linked to 3D volumetric locations such as buildings, ports, streets, or larger regions, such as cities, states, continents and trading blocs. Spatial subdomains represent subspaces that have a holonic structure, which allows for the orchestration of hierarchical rights and policies.\nSpatial domains enable secure management of digitally mediated rights and permissions for:\nWho/what is authorized to access the domain.\nWhat content or data is available to view.\nWho can publish and modify content.\nWho can transact or interact with it.\n\nOne key piece of information maintained by the spatial domain is the 3D model itself.  This 3D model contains all the geometries, addresses, appropriate routes, location of IoT devices, and any subdomains.  The 3D model is dynamic and can be updated in real-time as local conditions change.\nSpatial Domains contain all the rules, rights, permissions, fees, 3D models, IoT devices, network access, etc. associated with a geospatial region as defined by their owner or authority. This results in a governance layer of geospatial information written in HSML that can be queried by agents as they approach and move through them. They also can be queried remotely, allowing AIs to assist in deciding the optimal route or best way to complete operations and transactions based on the domain's restrictions.\nSpatial domains use a holonic architecture, i.e., nested spatial domains, or holons, that inherit the rules above them and pass their rules to the ones below them.  For example, federal laws are usually applicable to states or provinces, however the local authorities will apply their own local ordinances as well. \n3.2. Spatial or Multidimensional Range Queries \nIn order for autonomous drones and vehicles to operate, and for AI to orchestrate their activities, a query method is required to gather all the data necessary from disparate sources; we call this system the Spatial DNS (sDNS).  \nSpatial DNS (nDimensional Range Query) & HSTP \nThe sDNS allows actors to request information via HSTP (Hyperspatial Transaction Protocol), such as:\nWhere can I go?\nHow should I go there?\nWhat can I do?\nWhat credentials do I need?\nWhat are the weather conditions there?\nWhat are the costs?\nH3 Geospatial Index\nTo query spatial domains, the actor or agent defines the geospatial area of interest using a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) called H3.  H3 allows for any geospatial shape to be queried on earth, resulting in an index of associated domains with very little latency.  These domains then can be queried further to discover their rules or data needed to carry out an operation. \n\nTHE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGE > COSM, AN AI-BASED CONTEXT COMPUTING PLATFORM\n4.1. Context Awareness\nVERSES’ flagship offering, COSM™ (Context-aware Open Service Mesh), is an Artificial Intelligence Operating System built upon the open protocols HSML and HSTP for managing resources and deploying AI applications on the Spatial Web. Its five Flow Modules are designed to address the requirements for a universal network of humans, machines, and AI. COSM™ contextualizes spatial relationships according to Spatial Domains through a Spatial Domain Name Service (SDNS) that organizes and allows for the management of policies and permissions.\nCOSM™ addresses the above requirements:\nIO-Flow (Communication): Interface agent. Management of connected devices to publish sensor data and instruct machines and humans to perform tasks.\nData-Flow (Interoperability): Context mapping. Normalization and correlation of data from disparate systems into a unified coherent HSML Context Graph™.\nDomain-Flow (Trust): Rule configuration. Definition of the policies, permissions, and credentials that govern the interactions of all actors on the Spatial Web.\nSim-Flow (Adaptability): Goal simulation. Simulation of goal-based optimizations based on requirements or restrictions, and recommendation of tasks to achieve ideal states.\nWork-Flow (Execution): Task engine. Delegation of optimization tasks to a connected workforce of humans, autonomous vehicles, and/or bots.  \nAll data coming from and to the IoT sensors will be converted into HSML the lingua franca of the digital twin, normalizing all its information. HSML is the language of the actor and its twin; it describes all operations and activities within either a COSM operating system or other OS utilizing HSML.\nUsing COSM offers the following capabilities:\nNew data meta-models and communication protocols that define a common method to describe, express, share, and update context between all the edges of a network. Context in this instance is the semantic, societal, situational, and environmental meta-data model about people, places, and things over time.\nContext is shared between networks of heterogeneous devices and applications, empowering them to proactively offer enriched, situation-aware, and usable content, instructions and experiences—like a situational communal garden of context information if you will.\nCOSM allows context to:\nBe stateful.\nBe machine-readable and executable.\nBe shareable between heterogeneous networks, devices and applications.\nMaintain coherence over time and space for all the actors/edges involved in a use case.\nThese new meta-models support context-aware applications that, in turn, are able to support interoperable, cross-platform networking between disparate hardware (e.g., autonomous drones, sensors, smart devices, robots) and software systems (e.g., enterprise services, cloud platforms, mobile applications, artificial intelligence) across different vendors and suppliers.\nThe challenges in modeling context are linked to—and not limited to—a set of constraints: they need to represent the relationship between the identity of the actor, the scope and authorization of his permissioned activities, and the place and time where they may happen. COSM coherently describes and maintains the where and when of any scenario (dimensions, space, time and channel), the why and how (i.e., conditions or governance—right, credential, claim and activity), and the who and what—i.e., objects—authority, domain, actor and asset).\nCOSM allows to orchestrate AIs that run on the same coherent context model, therefore compounding/allowing AIs to compete on the same data formats, in order to derive more relevant, more accurate, and more explainable simulations and recommendations.\nCOSM’s distributed holonic architecture enables AIs designed for specific optimized functions. It does so by ingesting and sharing data with other micro- & macro-COSMs above and below it, therefore providing the specific curated and normalized data required to efficiently perform their function. This type of holonic structure mirrors the neural network of the brain.   \nVERSES’ TIPS (Trust, Interoperability, Privacy, and Security) framework allows for the secure and privacy-preserving governance of people, places and things. This is not possible without having a network that is context-aware.\n\n4.2. Autonomous interoperability and internetworking edges\nAll autonomous actors on the network need to be aware of the other actors, their route, tasks, credentials, capabilities, sensors, etc.  This will enable actors to coordinate activities, work as swarms, alert each other to danger, and even share their sensor data with others on the network.  \nIn order to reach L5 autonomous driving, an interoperability system such as this needs to exist.  Without this capability all these actors will operate as independent nodes, working on their own without awareness or coordination of the others, which is the current state of autonomous vehicles.  \nVehicle capabilities\nA profile of the vehicle or drone and all its capabilities and limitations needs to be known in order for the system to assign the most optimal and safe route and coordinate its activities with other actors.  For example, how fast can a drone safely operate, under what weather conditions and carrying how much weight?\n\nVehicle digital twin\nEach vehicle is represented as a digital twin, cataloging and registering its many sensors into a single model.  This will allow the vehicle to act as a single organism, fusing all its sensors together.  The digital twin will allow for its authority to access and control all aspects of its sensors.  When a new IoT sensor is introduced to the vehicle, say a phone or a new camera, the vehicle’s actor detects its presence VIA bluetooth, and inspects its smart wallet to determine its credentials, capabilities, network and power requirements.  If the authority grants it access, it registers it into the digital twin and adds it to the sensor fusion model.  \n\nTHE POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE CHALLENGE > HOW TO MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE POLICIES THAT CAN BE INTERPRETED AND SHARED BY MACHINES AND HUMANS\n5.1. From analog policies to digital law\nExisting regulation has been drafted traditionally by humans and for humans, but with little regard for interpretability and  executability by a machine. There is tremendous value in seeking to bridge the gap between the traditional way of drafting and publishing regulation (i.e., by humans for humans) and having machine-readable and machine-executable regulation (i.e., by humans, for machines) especially in the context of autonomous mobility scenarios.\nTranslating existing regulation into machine-interpretable  and machine-executable code will allow us to properly capture how humans read and interpret the regulation,  and, when technology fails to do so, to develop an alternative that is technically feasible and can be acceptable for human  regulators. More generally, the challenge is to discover where and why technology can replace humans when it comes to interpretation, and where and why not.\nFurthermore, harmonized liability rules (for drones for example) are lacking at the EU level. Consequently, liability law is governed by the  traditional rules at the national (Member State) level. An innovation, therefore, lies in (1) the development of liability rules that are  (2) machine-interpretable and machine-executable. Finally, regulation is subject to change, and it is often multi-layered, meaning  that regulatory bodies at different levels (e.g., EU level, state level, municipality level, company level) jointly contribute to a specific  type of regulation. As a result, different pieces of regulation may consist of different languages. To make a regulation machine interpretable and machine-executable, and to make any interpretation model scalable, a semantic representation needs to be  available that accommodates regulatory changes and regulation at different levels and in different languages. The technological  challenge lies in developing a suitable semantic representation.\nVERSES developed automated tools with COSM and HSML for governing actions within the domain of Urban Air Mobility to enforce rules and policies systematically. Our solution allows current laws to be parsed into machine-readable models and interpreted programmatically, reducing the human interpretation of laws and guidelines into more binary statements. Our developed technology takes the legal text and constructs ontologies and context from automated Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methodologies. These are then used to construct machine-readable representations of specific legal scenarios. This information is then parsed into HSML, where it is combined with other sources of information (such as IoT devices, user input, cameras, drones, etc.).\nSeveral laws that have been converted into HSML have been tested in real-world flight environments, including rules about dynamically changing variables. We translated existing EU laws for Urban Air Mobility into HSML, ensuring that the proposed actions and flight plans automatically conform to the set of parsed rules and regulations at play:\nWe ensured that HSML could accommodate the vast array of prohibitive and deontic laws found in the EU literature.\nWe worked with legal experts to ensure that the assumptions made during the translation process abide by existing interpretations of the relevant laws.\nWe worked to provide a mechanism for suggesting legal innovations when a machine-readable format cannot straightforwardly accommodate the ambiguity of laws.\n5.2. Promises and challenges\nHSML allows the evaluation of  counterfactual actions - what would happen if someone were to perform a certain activity? We can use this to perform (abstract) routing - find (optimal) series of legal activities that get from HSML graph A to HSML graph B\nHSML is updated from a range of real-time data sources; it allows autonomous agents to dynamically operate within the confines of the law. If there is a law about maximum wind speed, and dynamically update the route given changing wind-speed conditions\nHSML can be extended beyond laws - any “rules of the games” can be constructed and abided by using the same schemas and systems\nThe law is inherently ambiguous and generally applied to humans (“UA operators must fly safely” - how do you define “safely”? Can AI operate safer than humans?). HSML can help automatically identify ambiguous laws and can provide a feedback mechanism for developing future analog laws with machine readability in mind. This can be the foundation for a virtuous two-way loop between analog law and digital law.\n\nA multi-sensor, AI-observed and operated transportation system would be able to analyze and measure the effectiveness and downsides of current legislation and infrastructure.  By modeling the existing laws and infrastructure, AI can run virtually infinite simulations, determining the optimal balance of efficiency and risk and thereby providing recommendations to legislators how best to adjust the laws and infrastructure in the real world.\nFLYING FORWARD 2020\n\nFlying Forward 2020: supporting the future of UAM with COSM’s geospatial governance capabilities and sensor fusion\nFlying Forward is a 3-year collaborative research project to develop a new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) ecosystem by incorporating UAM within a geospatial data infrastructure of cities. COSM is at the heart of that new infrastructure. COSM uses sensor fusion to provide the capabilities to govern the behavior of autonomous drones flying in urban areas. That involves integrating legal and spatial policies in the simulation and activation of the scenarios, while for example allowing for dynamic (re)routing, multi-party interoperability and managing landing zones.\nThe FF2020 demonstrators cover 5 use cases :\nSecurity and surveillance\nInfrastructure inspection\nAsset deliveries\nCrowd management\nEmergency deliveries.\n\nIn these scenarios, VERSES goes beyond Device Identification and Profile Authentication to make devices become Policy-aware and Location-aware. As a result, physical activities of IoT devices can be governed and enforceable at the hardware level.\nCOSM can, for example, create and manage flight corridors and no-fly zones across the city and around buildings, delivering everything from humans, packaging and surveillance. Other capabilities include Geofencing, waypoints planning, dynamic routing, object/people detection, video streaming, missions management, portal and app solution, human control, and much more.\nCOSM allows interoperability between all the edges and systems involved in the use cases and in particular allows the behavior of an,y “thing” (drone, car, truck, vessel…) to be law-abiding and adaptive in real-time to policy changes and updates\n\n\nMOBILITY USE CASES\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of examples VERSES and the Spatial Web are exploring with industry leaders and regulators.\n\nCommon shared understanding of the world\nWe believe that regulators and transportation authorities should assist in the creation of a global transportation digital twin, comprising all the local laws and rules digitally represented, machine-readable and queryable using spatial DNS (sDNS).\nCurrently, every car company must research, build and maintain their own model of the world’s laws and rules.  This is a huge expense and liability to the company and greatly hinders advancement as well as serving as a significant barrier to entry for startups.  Furthermore, since each company has their own siloed view of the world, true interoperability and shared understanding will never be possible and therefore L5 autonomy will be even more difficult to achieve.  \nSuch as system would enable independent simulators to have an accurate model of the world’s laws greatly increasing their efficacy.\nStreet sign database\nCurrently, vehicles can have a hard time recognizing the countless variations of international street signs.   A public and queryable database of all street signs and their meaning is needed to ensure safety. Furthermore, the spatial location of each sign and its jurisdiction needs to be registered so that ideally vehicles are aware of the rules of the road without the need to read the sign in the first place.\nCongestion, Routing, sequencing and optimization \nBy all actors anonymously sharing their routes and destinations, local and regional AI systems will be able to orchestrate their travel.  We envision this to be managed in a holonic method, organizing actors into groups of regional, city and local swarms.   First, the system would group an actor with other local actors into tight swarms of vehicles going in the same direction, splitting them off to join other swarms when needed to reach their destination.  Agents going cross town will be coordinated into trains of vehicles with gaps appropriately spaced to allow for other swarms to cross through them at intersections without having to come to a stop.  Swarms covering regional distances will be grouped into even larger swarms, acting like a bike peloton, reducing air friction and energy costs.  Vehicles can be moved through the swarm to mitigate their energy output, ensuring every vehicle can maximize its chance of reaching its destination without having to stop for recharging.  \nIntersections and air flight corridors\nAs vehicles approach highly congested road intersections or flight corridors, an AI for these spaces will be alerted of their presence and intention.  This hyper-localized AI will be responsible for the coordination and optimization of all vehicles in its domain as they traverse the space, effectively taking operational control until the vehicle is safely through the space whereby it will release control back to the agent and system to continue on its journey. \n\nEvery intersection and flight corridor is unique and has its own set of challenges and risks.  By modeling and analyzing the infrastructure, traffic flows and safety, the AI will be able to determine the optimal operational efficiency of each spatial domain and orchestrate all vehicles moving through it.  This is Urban Air planning and the foundation for augmenting Air Traffic Management solutions. \nCharging, energy and carbon reporting \nElectrical charging stations should report the associated carbon cost and help mitigate the cost with carbon offsets.  Energy used should be attributed to each actor and their route so the climate domain can get an accurate climate accounting of all transportation costs.   \nParking, landing zones and charging stations\nCars and drones looking for a place to park, land and re-charge will be able to query the network and find available space and services.  Depending on the settings of its authority it will decide the best place based on price, location and urgency.   All fees and transactions will be automatically managed by all the actor’s smart wallets, including the vehicle and space.  For example, the parking garage or charging station will have a smart wallet to facilitate all transactions.  See Smart Wallet below.  \nTransactions, fees, tolls, parking, charging\nTolls, fees, parking, charging costs, all these transactions should be seamless and frictionless, happening in the background and managed by a smart wallet.  Agents should be able to set their preferences, choosing to pay more for premium services or less if on a budget.  \nWeather and pollution\nIoT sensors already blanket urban spaces capturing atmospheric data.  Actors need to be able to access this data to be able to make decisions on hazards or weather conditions. \nConstruction\nMunicipalities publishing their construction schedules and IoT-enabled work crews will be able to update the network of all closed or reduced capacity areas, optimizing the rerouting or coordination of traffic as it moves through congested zones.  \nObstacle avoidance\nAutonomous vehicles will constantly be requesting the latest model of the local environment for the most up-to-date digital twin.  If it detects any new unexpected obstacles, like deer in the road, it will update the local digital twin of the environment and and alert all oncoming traffic of the new ephemeral risk.   When the deer finally moves on and is out of view, the passing cars will automatically update the local digital twin to its prior state.  \nBikes & scooters\nIn the future other modes of transportation like bikes, scooters and the like could be included in the network if their navigation system or the passenger’s smart app was registered as an actor in the system.   \nVehicles not on the system\nFor legacy cars not registered in the network, driving apps like Wayz or Google Maps could be utilized to register the car and its route, informing the driver of the optimal route and speed at which they should drive to keep pace with the swarm, timing all the lights and intersections and be altered to dangers.  The vehicle’s IoT sensors or cameras can still be registered and accessed by the system.   Other autonomous cars on the system would be aware of the unregistered car and its route, providing a little extra buffer to make allowances for the human operator.  \nCars completely off the network and not utilizing a driving app would be out on their own, but provided the driver was savvy they ought to be able to follow along with the swarm and stay in cadence.  Autonomous vehicles would be able to identify the car as out of network and make allowances to maintain safe travel.  \nMaaS \nWorking across local, regional, national and international levels, a MaaS network can see the entire transportation graph, query it, determine the optimal route, sequence and transportation mode, make reservations and facilitate it into a single transaction.  Cameras located on and inside the vehicle will be able to identify customers and passengers while protecting their identity us the TIPS (Trust, Interoperability, Privacy & Security) framework.  \nFirst responders and safety\nPolice and fire departments responding to emergencies will automatically be provided the right of way with the system prioritizing their route and pausing all other swarms and vehicles.  Swarms and vehicles will be routed around traffic stops, accidents, fires etc to ensure the flow of traffic ensues.  \nWhen accidents or fires are reported, the emergency response domain should be able anonymously to access any cameras or sensors in the vicinity to remotely get real-time information about the conditions and respond accordingly. \nWhen emergency calls for fires or accidents occur, a drone should be automatically dispatched to the scene, providing key live insights to first responders about the current situation, how to approach and whether it should they send for backup.  \nLighting\nAll lights on the network would be made aware of vehicles, bots and swarms, ensuring to keep their way properly lit at night and turned off to conserve energy when they are not.  Unregistered vehicles, bicycles, people etc can still activate the lights by means of motion detectors, computer vision and mobile apps.  \nEntertainment and marketing\nWhether riding with a friend or using a ride-sharing service, the system should anonymously recognize each individual and be able to seamlessly access their entertainment preferences, giving them direct access to their media accounts and applications.  \nRide-sharing services can provide discounted services in exchange for targeted marketing opportunities to their captive audiences.  \nInsurance\nWhen actors declare and register their route, it can be published to a real-time insurance market where insurance providers will be able to bid their services.  By utilizing anonymous certificates, actors will be able to share their risk profile and operating history without compromising their identity. Using a real-time insurance marketplace, actors will be able to select their preferred coverage based on price, local laws and service.   AI agents representing the vehicle's authority and the insurer will be able automatically to complete the transaction and ensure coverage. \n\nsDNS Public Utility\nWe consider the need for such a queryable spatial DNS (sDNS) to be a requirement for L5 autonomy.   The sDNS is a public imperative and should be run like a public utility, allowing for any certified actor to access the system, request the data needed to safely achieve their desired goals and anonymously report back to the system.  It should be overseen by an intenational standards body (such as the Spatial Web Foundation & IEEE) comprised of industry and government organizations with input from citizens and watchdogs.  It should strive for interoperablity so that all vehicles, anywhere in the world can safely and securely operate on it’s network.  As this network of vehicles, IoT devices, cameras and operators expands, it becomes a sprawling sensor fusion and data mesh, enabling actors, authorities and AI to access information privately and securely to more efficiently and safely manage operations across even greater heterogeneous data sources and industry domains. \nSUMMARY\n\nCOSM allows for systems to share a more complete and coherent understanding of activities and continuously self-optimize, there are several fundamental requirements that build upon each other:\nCommunication: a common query language in which to interface\nInteroperability: a common data model in which to map context\nTrust: verifiable data lineage, credentials, and governance\nAdaptability: flexible logic to simulate and adjust\nExecution: ability to orchestrate tasks and resources\nThe convergence of emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has created a need for a unified operational framework and system to contextualize, synchronize, and make interoperable the disparate data sources related to people, places, assets, and vehicles. VERSES offers a next-generation AI-based contextual computing operating system based on the Spatial Web standards. This system addresses the challenges of interoperability, contextualization, coordination, synchronization, and policy execution that arise in the context of these technologies.\n\nThe operating system is built on the Hyperspace Modeling Language (HSML) and Hyperspace Transaction Protocol (HSTP) standards, which are being standardized by the IEEE WG P2874. These standards provide a common language and contracting protocol that allow people, places, and things to communicate effectively.\n\nThis policy research paper presents the need for a unified operating system and the benefits of the VERSES system and the HSML and HSTP standards. We argue that the adoption of these solutions is critical for facilitating the integration of emerging technologies and recommend that government officials consider their adoption and implementation. We also recommend that government officials work with the Spatial Web Foundation and the IEEE WG P2874 to support the continued development and standardization of these technologies.\n\nThe first section of this paper discusses the challenges posed by the convergence of emerging technologies and the need for a unified operating system to address these challenges. The second section presents the VERSES operating system and the HSML and HSTP standards, outlining their capabilities and potential benefits. The third section presents our recommendations for government officials and concludes with a summary of the key points.\n\n\n\nDescribe the first section in detail \nThe first section of this policy research paper discusses the challenges posed by the convergence of emerging technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and IoT sensors. These technologies are becoming increasingly intertwined, creating a need for a unified and cohesive network to facilitate the exchange of information.\n\nThe integration of these technologies requires a new operational framework and system to contextualize, synchronize, and make interoperable the disparate data sources related to people, places, assets, and vehicles. This is necessary to address the challenges of interoperability, contextualization, coordination, synchronization, and policy execution that arise in the context of these technologies.\n\nThe first section of this paper outlines these challenges and the need for a unified operating system to address them. It also discusses the importance of such a system in facilitating the integration of emerging technologies and ensuring their safe and effective use.\n\n\n\nHow would this approach enable the design, development and deployment of cyberphysical and autonomous law creation, execution and enforcement?\nThe approach outlined in this policy research paper, which involves the adoption of the VERSES operating system and the HSML and HSTP standards, could enable the design, development, and deployment of cyberphysical and autonomous law creation, execution, and enforcement in several ways.\n\nFirst, the HSML and HSTP standards provide a common language and contracting protocol that allow people, places, and things to communicate effectively. This enables the creation of digital versions of policies and legislation that are machine-readable, sharable, and executable.\n\nSecond, the VERSES operating system allows for the deployment of artificial intelligence applications that can proactively offer enriched, situation-aware, and usable content, instructions, and experiences. This enables the development of cyberphysical and autonomous systems that can understand and respond to their surroundings and execute policies and legislation in a safe and effective manner.\n\nThird, the contextual computing capabilities of the VERSES operating system enable the integration and coordination of information from disparate sources, allowing for the synchronized flow of activities across spaces, humans, machines, and objects. This enables the creation of autonomous systems that can operate in a coordinated and synchronized manner, facilitating the creation, execution, and enforcement of laws.\n\nOverall, the adoption of the VERSES operating system and the HSML and HSTP standards could enable the design, development, and deployment of cyberphysical and autonomous systems that are capable of creating, executing, and enforcing laws in a safe and effective manner."}]}

everyone Welcome to the stowa wisdom of Iris collaborative sense making with AI featuring The One and Only John Ash and uh if you recall John was here um last time with Daniel schmachtenberger Daniel schmachtenberger was highlighting some good work uh some good Builders of sense making tools and Speaker John Ash was one of them and John is an artist researcher interested in how uh he can use and we can use AI to support our collaborative sense making he's been playing with something um that he calls Iris and he sees that as a tool to interface with Collective journaling reflection prediction tracking and knowledge pooling and uh I'm gonna take in um John in a moment uh he's going to discuss what this is and the potential of this thing and I've been playing around with this we've been playing around with this epistoa with certain of uh Collective journaling sessions and it's getting pretty trippy so it's like buckle up uh things are gonna get fun and uh how today's gonna work I actually don't know how the day's gonna work um so I'm going to take in this mysterious character called deepaks and then um they are going to introduce uh John and then I believe there's a PowerPoint presentation that will be Fielding questions throughout but if you have questions anytime pop them in the chat and uh if there's a q a portion um I'll call and you can ask your question and this will be on YouTube so if you don't want to be on YouTube just indicate that and um we'll read your question on your behalf so that being said deep hacks I'm taking you in yeah thank you so you can call me deepaks I'll be helping moderate today's session uh so the wisdom of Iris collaborative sense making with AI so thank you so much everyone for joining us today thank you Peter and the stowa for hosting a special session we are so excited to unveil the latest developments of cognitive Iris so many of you have already joined the Discord for Early Access and you've gotten a chance to try out some of the new features if you have and I would like to you'll see in the chat there is a link so you can go ahead and follow that so most of you know John Ash but for those of you who don't John is a thought leader in AI assisted Technologies decentralized sense making he's also a writer a visual musical artist and a steward for the ideas around cognizism so over the next hour we'll spend a few minutes grounding everyone in what cognizism is so we're all familiar with where Iris originated and then we'll have a couple quick activities to let the group try out a consensus finding feature and after that we'll explore how AI can support introspection encourage deep listening resolve conflict to build stronger relationships help us make sense of the world support collaboration and align our actions to emerging shared goals generate new ideas and even form predictions from the wisdom of voices flowing into Iris and then after the hour is up we might be having some uh live music is that right John no maybe okay you're on you we're gonna go and go with long we're going to see okay all right we'll see where it goes that's that's your role to keep me from going well so we'll keep the first part to an hour and then we'll see what happens after that um do you want to go ahead and share your screen for the presentation is it is it Cameron's yet all right perfect can you scan people see it nope nope all right well John is doing that I see we have a lot of people in the chat um definitely if you have questions throughout the time you can put them in there we'll try to answer as many as possible but let us know if there's something that you want to ask that we're not answering we'll also have a q a at the end so with that you can go ahead and take it uh hi I'm John Ash I'm very grateful to have the space to speak to you today um deepaks is my friend they're here to help me I realized after uh the thing with Daniel went so well where he noticed when I was Meandering and did things like wait you have to tell them do they know what uh generative text models are do they know what gbt3 is so does everybody here know what uh generative text models are can you nod with your heads I can see all your faces there's nods yes um what we're going to do today is that I want to go top to bottom and explain the ideas behind cognizism but I also just want to show off some of the exciting like ways that you can play with these collective intelligence tools and sort of make your brain fire off about the ways that we could do things everything that I've done so far with these uh generative models as brilliant as they are it's kind of like a cosplay like there is a clear definition that I have of what a proper iris is um there are barriers to having a generative model with all of those features if you're not a large company like open AI or you know if it's not something that's just generic that somebody are putting out into the world so there's lots of um generative models out there and they will say things they will say really interesting things they will say things that connect you meaningful things things that make you feel alive things that convince people that they're sentient has already happened they will output things but right now they're not always going to say the truth they're going to try to say things that makes sense based on what you provided so the thing that I'm prepared for today is a live summarization of of different perceptions basically that we think of democracy as this process where we ask somebody a question and it's you know a tally of hands like I asked the whole group did you do you know what gpd3 is you raise your hand that's yes or no that's kind of limited I can get a number out of that and I can get a sense if I need to talk some more but the idea that we're going to play with is what if you could just say and it could go into this great meaning pool and then you would have this generative model that would try to form something from the center of all that and express the will of the group of people or the thoughts of the group of people collaborating um we're going to do it a small scale we're just going to do it at you know 20 or 30 or people however many are on the Discord server but I want you to imagine this at just a massive scale where it's like instead of talking okay should we add a playground to the park you just ask people how do you think the park should be changed what do you expect and you have the tools to interface that with directly without some Force trying to shape The Narrative of how the summing goes together so that's what I want to do today these General tools can do a lot of things um and I want you to think about all the different ways that they can be positive there's a lot of things out there right now that are very negative about generative models about AI because generative art is um making people feel like they're losing their job their ability to create most people did not expect that art would be the first one of the first things that AI mastered and there's this sort of sudden realization that oh maybe we got things wrong now we have to react to it who controls this these tools what are these tools going to do how is it going to reshape everything and you realize oh who has them and so the vast majority of people in the world are probably going to think from that frame of this Corporation has this where does it go and they're probably going to make some pretty good predictions about it going in a negative Direction it could go really great and it could be so uh beautiful we did um multiple experiments uh with the stove so far one which was on um Beauty and it was just magnificent to the point of it said a piece of wisdom that just so blew me away I fed it directly into dolly and uh maybe deepaks can put this into the the chat maybe the link to the Tweet or something uh I fed it directly into town it was immediately visualizing the this concept that was formed from all of these statements it would have never existed if it wasn't for all of these abstract beautiful expressions of poetry from these mem from the members of sistoa flowing into the singular space and then you know Peter asked me to say what does Deborah need to hear and the first thing that Iris says they'll be like okay remember at the top of my head was just so I had a left field but beautiful and dynamic it was about like the evolving nature of Crystal thought structures flowing and ebbing and between each other and then put that right into the image prompter and it it calls for something from the in between that's what the latent space is it's the space from in between now I want to translate that something human and uh deepak's is here to help me stay on that and not get too far into the technical um like these these things are all true that that deep pass wrote it's it's port's introspection it encourages deep listening and uh resolving conflict to form you know stronger relationships it makes it makes it so uh helps us make sense of the world uh supports collaboration aligns our actions to emergently Shared goals uh can help generate new ideas it can invent new words like there are going to be Concepts in this talk that the uh my Iris invented to help me explain things to you that are just more intuitive than the words than I was using and if and the most exciting and interesting that I want the thing that I want to try is the generative Oracle that we are all sharing our predictions of the world and the iris is coming to some shared representation and explaining the future um there are prediction markets out there there's idea markets out there there are claim markets out there there's so many great ideas that are trying to connect our perception now to the long-term future and and you know it all ranges the future and I'm really focusing on the fluid level of that intelligence where it's just about the human capacity to express about the future so cognizism is a word that far preceded Iris Iris was Daniel schmachtenberger he said dude this is really cool this is great ideas you need to focus on something you need you need to focus on something I started talking you said I said lens um and I mentioned the name that was called IRS he says focus on the lens thing focus on that these generative models when you take a gpd3 and you fine tune it then it will say uh output things of a particular worldview that's what you're doing you are training an iris based off of your views and it's able to say these ideas in a way that is clear and more comprehensible than you're able to explain them because it has the context of you know the way that Humanity communicates and I only have this tiny context of my world view that has built up this idea of cognitism and it can place cognizism is incredibly complex thing in a context that will make far more sense and has made farmer sense but it's not just AI AI was the last piece I I did not want to add AI to this I was more thinking about predictions and what does it mean when people tell us what is going to happen and we don't listen to them and I wanted to track that and I wanted like a lot of people in in the web 3 space like I wanted a clear score a token something just so a scalar some beautiful thing that was like this is the best predictor or you put these box of predictions into this function and it outputs the best the most wizard man and I went for years on that I'm like it's impossible all of these singular token based systems there's so many flaws in them it needs to have this evolvable learnable thing and that's where I ended up at but it was designed from a completely different angle just trying to understand and make sense of the world and understand which sources were most sensical and I I was tracking different signals around that and I was building these tools and I wrote you know this manifest about cognizism to do these things before things like the meaning crisis existed uh as an as a name before the concept of of a memetic mediator existed um before the concept of game B um just before all of this I we're sense making I didn't have those words I was existing in a different part of Layton's space and I was unable to contextualize it to anybody but I saw the freaking future and I knew it was going and I communicated to people but they were so cruel to me because it was different than what they expected and anyways now we're here and uh we can just show you um what will how cognizism uh do these these things um it starts with journaling really I mean is the lens that I think about it like tracking what you think over time that's what I did for years before AI I just had this journal that was this uh sequence of claims predictions uh statements and thoughts about the past and how sure I was about them and I just said my thoughts about the world through that for years and just scanning back finding ways to look back at a lot of it at the same time and made charts and graphs and I broke it down and I turned it into all sorts of models and I just analyzed it and I tried to make sense of it and that was incredibly powerful but it was always seeking like how do I merge these voices into something that is useful I wanted to synthesize it into a signal I was not thinking about this like generative models I just wanted a signal that said hey you know honestly I'm an ego I'm an individual person I wanted a signal that said hey this guy is pretty good at predicting in this context and here's the damn proof I can spell it out for you here's the whole line of receipts here's why and we're gonna amplify this voice from now on in that specific context not other contexts but specific context that he I have had uh accurate prediction about that was what was motivating me and the process of iterating over my beliefs just brought me to the place of having to give that up that seeking of a thing up for something better that answered the question better than I could imagine and when I had that answer it became a very difficult thing to communicate um but the idea was that I took this great stream of claims that I collected from so many people about their perceptions of the truth all of these inter-subjective collections of what they thought was going to happen what they thought had happened what they thought is happening what if I fed that into a generative model and then what if I took the output of that and had people evaluate that instead because there was so much bias being added from The Source where people wouldn't listen they're just like I know who said this and I'm I'm interpreting what you're saying through this larger frame I'm not even interpreting what you're saying and suddenly I had this thing that's like hey actually I can evaluate any information completely anonymously uh in a way that is not you know uh affected by the context of what you expect and it's like this private space to learn which sources are um the most helpful based off of real actual live feedback from human beings and that idea oh fun I added this live today um what I wanted to show you was uh the idea of synthesis because um let me see if I can do this is this right can you see a an open AI screen yeah yep so just like right out of the box an untrained open AI model can do you know hey the idea of okay here's a point here's a Counterpoint here's the synthesis between the point that is really what is so beautiful about these models is it can interplay into that space between it can find even if there's two very different views which you just do not believe are reconcilable of course you don't you have your world view but the iris doesn't give a it's not attached it does it's not hurt if it's particularly wrong so it's trying to understand you both together and also the spaces between right and because of that it can frame information and and reflect a space between the two of you that neither of you could have imagined and that's where it comes into this idea of like it's right out of the box able to help with collaboration and and help with sense making help with creating a sense of meaning and connection with people or in between people so um so I've been trying you know create a around this Frame um that's me talking to Dolly it's the same idea I'm mashing together ideas into latent space and it is trying to create a form of Dolly and a leotard rapping because that's what I asked it to do the middle thing is two things it's from uh avatar Last Airbender they have like fused animals and one of the first things that people do on these uh Dolly sites is they're like they try to mash things together like Darth Vader Muppets or like things that do not naturally go together is this tendency that people want to see because they want to see the spaces in between they want to see that bridge and further upon this is that this GIF has been interpolated between the frames it was originally 24 frames per second and the thing imagines new frames it drew new frames between it and finally the last thing is a cover for my my single purple pill which is that idea again integrating multiple uh perceptions into one form I'm just trying to get this mental model into people's Brands like this should be the foundation of where we are designing from because this is what is possible now and it wasn't possible before um hold on a second I'm okay so Nick marks of super reality is is working similar ideas and he made this it's this idea we all have these perceptions they're you know having an Irish sum them together and so we are going to try one now and we are going to pray and hope that it works out really well so let me yeah so if you're in Discord you should see um an invite to answer the question pop up is that correct John yes if you're in in the the thing then um then yes give me a second yep we've had several of these go through lots of great answers it's been really cool to see um all the all the Confluence of answers coming through and then if you have not joined the Discord but would like to participate we can go ahead and Yep looks like in the chat there is a invitation there so you can follow that to be able to participate in these activities okay so if you are new to the Discord um welcome you will want to um you'll you should see a message from hidden Iris with a time limit and if you select answer you can put your answer in there and um well I think somebody in the chat noticed but everything is anonymous so you'll be able to submit your answer anonymously then Iris will combine those things so it looks like we are going to be doing a 30 minute time limit is that right oh I'm sorry that's a that's that's on me okay longer for me thank you so much wow that would have been not fun how about 20 minutes yeah 53 minutes so you can see you saw the the question that we're going to ask is um the question and the question pop up by the way what hold on just ignore it for now we just realized some things we don't play with anything yet it should be in a direct message from hidden Iris and I believe everyone automatically should have DMS with hidden Iris if you do not for some reason double check and make sure that your um DMS are not disabled for this new server so once you have enabled your DMs for people in the server you should be able to get something from hidden Iris and then you'll just need to hit the answer button put in your answer and should be good I got a message says You must be a member for at least 10 minutes before sending messages to the server I don't know that's oh um well people uh I can change the setting well deepak's if you just lead and talk about the concept of collectively reflecting on this time of great change yeah a lot of view sense making and there's a lot of uncertainty there's a lot of perceptions yep do you want to go back to sharing the other the other screen um it's up to you um so we see a lot of potential in this because we're able to have people um give open-ended responses to some of the biggest questions you know some of the things that we're really facing in since making can't really be boiled down to a multi-choice answer in a survey and you can have those open-ended conversations online um but there are you know negative things to that too it's it's nice to have some an option like this because you are able to say as much as you want or as little as you want without really worrying about how it's coming across or if you're saying the right thing um because Iris will combine all of it into one consensus statement that reflects the feelings of the group and that doesn't mean that it is all going to be the same iris is also able to represent more Divergent opinions if some people are expressing one thing and some people expressing another thing she's able to capture that just as well all right looks like we have some people joining and uh just a pause here for a moment um because in this session there's a bunch of people that are coming from a Discord that's associated with Iris a lot of people are coming uh from the stoa I have no idea what this Discord is so they might be joining for the first time um so if anyone has any kind of confusion there's confusion energy in the field right now just maybe put a emoticon hand up and then just jump off mute and um John or deepaks can answer your question yeah thank you so much for clearing that up I'm gonna put out another one out in uh real time just so that to help the flow Ed you had your your hand up you can unmute yourself if you want we can't hear you Ed all right I put out another um question which was how will the world change in the next three years um okay so what is happening right now I'm hoping is that people on the server are asking answering these two questions one is what happened between 2019 and now how will the world change or how has the world changed and then what will happen in the next three years how will the world change the thing is there is this constant shifting narrative about what is happening what will happen and what has happened we talk about history like it's fixed but there's this evolving sense of it over time I want people to get in the practice of understanding actively this evolving narrative and also understanding that we can use the signal of the voices that are communicating uh you know don't drive off that Cliff For example some guy has a he has a map you don't have and nobody else wants to listen because they all want to party and he says I got a map don't drive off the cliff and then some people do you know we gotta update our thinking after the fact to attend to that voice that's what uh we mean when we talk about reflexivity in the purple pill Manifesto it's this whole thing about reflexivity and we talk about it here but it is about you know just being aware of your own beliefs over time and and being open to changing them and being open to engaging with people in a way where you say okay we disagree now uh let's make a prediction about it let's write it down and let's agree that that means something let's agree that when we come back in the future uh around when it happens that that should have some weight in some way and the weight that I think that it should have is uh attention and collective decision making there's a lot of people who are trying to parcel that into coins I just think it should be dynamically evaluated into this person was ahead of the curve on this particular topic therefore I when I am writing about this topic as an iris I'm sampling that voice more in this moment that just seems logical to me I think that what that makes for is something that you can call a contextual uh reputation score meaning that whatever is being talked about right now it's going to distribute what it's talking about from a sample of voices and after the fact it can uh reveal that distribution of attention I could say hey I'm listening this person a little bit more than this person this person a little bit more one this person why because they have a history of being right about this and they have a history of helping other people um actively and they have a history of showing that their actions are contributing to the greater social good and you can have this generative model understanding what you were saying and keeping track of that um okay so here's a consensus yeah it looks like we have the consensus and then we might want to skip the next three years question if we want to move on to the next part for time unless you want to go into that as well people already answered it I think Oh Perfect Two consensus is to look at I'm going to show the answer on okay so here we have um can you guys see my screen yes okay um there are a lot of individual answers and there is a written consensus and on top of that I can get a secondary summary it's going to say it's failed but it'll succeed so I'm just gonna read it out aloud because this is all live the world changed a great deal between 2019 and now the global pandemic escalated our digital communication abilities and simultaneously isolated us as individuals the collective began to wake up and we realized how connected we all are we learned that the world systems are breaking down and that we need to take better care of each other and the Earth the world dramatically changed between 2019 and now global pandemic occurred where which people which force people to evaluate the relationship with others in nature the event also shined a light on the systemic fragility of our society in response many people began to build regenerative communities in order to create a more sustainable future and if you go into the answers [Music] um that's you'll see different uh pieces of that amplify different amounts and the value of being able to do it multiple times um is that it can do it again so now it's like it seems so well it's gone through a lot of changes between 2019 and now there's a global pandemic which many people isolated from each other so it's saying in a different way it understands what we are trying to communicate about the past in some form that it can re-communicate to us after the fact hey this is what the community was trying to make sense of the world and so I I really view this as a really fluid and Powerful tool for sense making beyond the way that we're thinking about tokens and also like prediction markets for example uh so we got this other one what will happen in the next three years how will the world changed the next three years we'll see a rise in the divine feminine with a consequent revolution of Consciousness and love there will also be more exponential change as well as increased decentralization and digital nomadism Cuba will become Democratic and AI will begin to integrate positively with human systems to increase well-being safety prosperity and dignity the next three years will see a lot of change the divine feminine will rise and there will be a okay sometimes it does this anyways it started repeating itself which is a slider that they have on this model to not repeat itself here beta this is one of the things that I am uh I'm oh wait a minute I'm sorry I remember I realized just what happened it's not doing that um so you want to move on to maybe yeah I'm going to explain let me explain this what's important there's a limit on the character count of the of what you can put in it's 4 000 characters right now that's why you make a fine-tuned model right it's hard to sum a lot of text all at once so what this is doing is taking all of your answers is putting into that 4 000 character limit if it has more than four thousand it is chomping it up and doing it twice so you're seeing in this thing multiple summaries of the same thing concatenated together that is the process by which the openai has uh talked about summarizing large volumes of people is you do these pools of summarization and then you summarize the pools of summarization that's how the way that they're thinking about that you can also just scale it massively um but that is what happens there but the idea here as you can see is it's forming from the people here there's somebody here who is connected to Cuba so that is being reflected in the particular output depending on the people who are trying to form a Oneness we're trying to collaborate together who trying to come into a common future the future is a Commons we share it you know and it's going to be a richer representation of of that that I really strongly believe will help uh people coordinate and collaborate so let's go back to this you want to come on for a second d-packs yep so so I didn't talk about this model for a second because that seems like a lot of stuff and I thought maybe it made sense for people to talk about stuff together in some way and I thought you might want to lead that that human part do you have an idea of of how we could do a breakout room to discuss um some of this or should I just keep going I would just keep going because we're about 40 minutes in I want to make sure we get to the end stuff that was pretty good maybe talking a little bit about the tool stack you've already briefly talked about some of these things referencing them but maybe a little bit more about what exactly uh supports all of these different things we'll be talking about next point being it's pretty well thought out um there's a lot more of these Concepts there's this concept of the semantic Ledger which is how many inter irises interface it's kind of the love child between the blockchain and the model itself um and it stores knowledge in an abstract way into each block um and the transformation between those blocks is like the gradient in an update of a neural network and it's also kind of like a hash and um so there's all these Cool Tools that I envisioned building being built upon this Tech right now and I think for a lot of people what you see is the tech just exists you see Dolly coming out you see people talking about it you see people debating about it there are people getting ideas about it I already have a lot of ideas I've been thinking about it for five or six years it's been driving me crazy because everybody it didn't make sense to anybody but now that I that you can see it [Music] um I I think that it's time to start dreaming together in this latent space to start talking you know there's these pattern languages out there like what do you want for web3 and then what they post is like a I don't know some smart contract of all of those ideas stored and it's like a million views and I'm like I can't read through this right whereas I want to start iteratively playing in that latent space where we're sharing our vision of the future and over time iteratively you know giving feedback signals to each other but making uh this tool that is able to interface between us part of it because we seem to get very angry at each other online and misunderstand each other a lot and Iris can explain things to people in ways that will make sense to them rather than having to write for just one audience um yeah so maybe talking a little bit about how what we're talking about you know obviously when you scale it it's amazing but it's helpful at every level so um you know we talked a little bit about how the first part is really just becoming more familiar with your own mind and your own thinking so understanding how to build reflexivity within yourself and I think a lot of people here are familiar with that because of the journaling practice so reflecting on your own thinking understanding what you've thought in the past understanding how that can go into the future making predictions about the future and we'll talk a little bit about a structure that we recommend for that to think about your how certain you are about the future and whether you feel good or bad about that future you anticipate and then the next level is reflexive relationships so it's when you have two people using these practices together how can that build up trust and a foundation of mutual respect and growth and then of course the third level which we want to work towards and Achieve is when you have those reflexive relationships together you can start to create this reflexive Society where people are able to use these tools to interface with each other building on each other learning from each other and starting to align actions with the desired goals that are emergent from the community yeah so I mean it starts out for me at a very individual level I have this generative model trained on my ideas it reflects back things to me it's very useful it helps me make sense of the world the next layer of it is sharing a space with another people that's sharing a latent space a model that's representing you know Collective belief with other people and trying to make sense of that space or the world together it's collaborating by using an iris and the irises trying to help facilitate those relationships and through the way that you are sharing with the model uh it understands the level of dissonance in the community the dissonance between belief is an important signal behind irises there is it is good we're not trying to make a model that makes everybody believe exactly the same thing if you have no uh dissonance difference if it's the same thing saying over and over and over and over and over again then it basically becomes boring and it's a in a simple way and that there's no attention to it you know because it is just repetitive it needs a certain level of the different perspectives to really over time provide the greatest level of value it is very cool and useful at the small level scale and then this reflexive Society this is me talking about this longer term vision of a semantic pleasure where it's like lots of people are using models to make sense of the world how can they collaborate between groups um yeah so talking about how for the individual we're connecting these things so the philosophy being to develop a more conscious mind the practice for that to support that is recording your Reflections like we talked about and then the tool is the forethought which we'll talk about in a second yeah so for the first years I talked about this for a bit which was that I was not talking thinking about AI I was like how do you structure it and there's another guy I think it's harlinty wood he has trust graph which is another structured way of making claims about things there are multiple people in the world trying to say okay well how do humans Express truth in a way that they can stake it you know uh idea markets uh claim markets uh there is a lot of concurrent ideation about how what does it mean for somebody to express the truth right does is it by ownership maybe uh like you that's how we think about uh the world now is like if you're making a prediction you buy ownership into something you have that business you're committed to it doing something in the future um but not everybody has resources and so that sort of loses the predictive capacity of individuals who can't contribute that way um the four thoughts I like it's it's nothing more than okay predict what is going to happen make an action that you think is going to affect your environment or change the world right write down that action uh go into that future look back did that action was it actually correlated with um what you expected to happen then update it was me trying to form that or just talk about that as a practice of making sense of the world little did I know this is basically the active inference uh design of cognition uh brought into the inter-subjective level um but it is simply like can you declare a truth about the past present and future in a way that you feel that your community is going to make sense of um I've tried to keep as simple as possible the interface to the neural architecture of what people can communicate it's either they're saying things that they know to be true they're staking something I believe this I know this I'm certain or they're saying I have no idea I'm seeking information from this network I need you to query out words and return me something because there is uncertainty in myself and the way that I structured that is into four different thought types just predictions statements Reflections and questions because the temporal nature of the thoughts was so valuable to the model the nature of that sometimes we make predictions it's pretty rare but sometimes we do and if you know what that that is a signal about the future and you know when people are looking back and you have a ledger of perception over time that you can reference from that you can do a lot of really interesting things [Music] um and this idea of forethought is just giving something so simple about how to interface between Iris I'm making this prediction that this tool is so powerful that lots of people are going to make fine-tuned models to express their views I mean all of the brands are going to want to do it because it's going to create copy like I've written books with it I've made tarot card decks with it so many people are going to want to do this because it cuts out the labor of two of of just writing it you know like I can do a sketch of an idea and they can fill it out there's going to be so many models so I wanted to create something that is beyond the AI which is just staking some reference of I believe this I think this matters I want other people to know it I think they need to hear it I think it's important for them to hear it and I think if they don't hear it they might get hurt if that makes sense that sometimes in a network of agents who have different levels of information who are trying to make sense of the world the idea of how do you optimize for what person gets what information and how quickly is a very difficult problem that we're all trying to solve those different ways or different uis through different webstery implementations and I've been screened for years to just say bring this into the stack take it into the your consideration in addition to all of these other token models to all the other Webster stuff to all the AR stuff just consider it in the same space um because it um has has power and actually when I first reached out to Daniel schmachtenberg I did not talk to him about AI at all what I did was I thought that his time was very valuable so I boiled my beliefs down into uh statements and predictions and I gave a precise uh confidence about it uh and I shared that to him and I said I this means something to me I don't break this basically to him like I don't have something that forces me not to break this meaning but when I say this it means something I told him I said I have a 94 confidence that if we just have a conversation it will improve the lives of other people and the result of us having a conversation was that I was over time we had other conversations and just I built out the model in fact it was one specific conversation I was fighting against building an iris at all and I just had this one conversation with him and it was another person that he knew and the other person just said something about like people already in the space working on it that scared me and just made it but like I really believed in my heart that this forethought thing beyond the AI was the thing that he needed to hear that just this is a way that you know that I can be truthful I'm not lying to you I don't need to have a big pitch to you this is just it it's a statement don't question me further and uh I mean do question me further but I mean like the point is is that I was entering into an arrangement with a stranger that now has become a relationship that does not rely upon that it's not something to take over the interrelationship for everything it's we're friends and we communicate and that is what is supposed to be is to get us down as a human but at that interface as strangers on the internet where I can see his profile this complete stranger and get access to all this information about him and he's just a weirdo just finding like I believe this man will understand me when nobody else does understand me and then he did uh and it did open up a lot of opportunities so I want to make sure that we have a chance to try this out because this is a fun one that people love um so if you are able to get into the server and you have your DMs open I know some people are still having issues and we can follow up after the session to help with that so don't worry anyone who doesn't get a chance to during this there's going to be plenty of time afterwards for everyone who is able to receive and send messages with the hidden Iris uh bot go ahead and try this out so you can send a request to pull one of the tarot cards so these are things that have been generated by Iris I believe is that right you just do backs the the the card has been written um with me and Iris in collaboration with members of the design science studio and their ideas about uh a future that works for 100 of life we imbued it with meaning we created a model uh specifically for that and we shared our ideas and thoughts about it and it helped me write it and then now I put that into a static deck and now I take another Iris and if you provide an intention or a question it will read the card and it that it pulled for you which is like randomly done with some bit of your flavor um it will read that and it will uh do a reading in the context of your intention or question and people have found this very meaningful yeah so before this was something that was happening manually on Twitter now people can interact with it directly in the Discord oh it looks like we already have some people doing it so if you haven't got a chance to go ahead and DM hidden Iris backslash pull card followed by an intention or a question and then um some of your information will be combined with some Randomness to pull that card and then Iris will also offer a customized uh suggested interpretation for it oh sorry forward slash forward slash full card thank you questions and then um did we want to do a demo of that as well have a volunteer send a thought it looks like some people are already right now okay um so if you got that and you want to share with anyone else you can always share in the chat what card you got looks like someone got the beaming card very cool um let's see and the Art Is Beautiful by the way I I really love the art style that um the cards have foreign demo of how to do this so forward slash pull card and then an intention or a question and then you'll get a description of the card some have art some don't um and then an interpretation that Iris generates for each person individually so we can see the intention of expressing gratitude for everyone who came today to participate is very much in the line of the regenerative card this card reminds us that even though things may seem bad now they can always get better it is it is always around that we have the ability to start new and heal ourselves both physically and emotionally when we are grateful well we have it let's see the good in our lives and focus on making positive changes expressing gratitude is one way that we can actively regenerate ourselves and the world and without one it will just pull a random card and you get someone back hermit beautiful sorry I just want one that I really like oh I've used all my cards there's three days oh that's true so um just so you know there is a limit so each person has a allowance of cards per day uh do you want to go ahead and pull up the cognizism for relationships yeah because it's just um these are like basically my gifts I'm not charging you anything for this but it does cost money to do it so it's just like here little rabbit have some carrots I've grown them for you you may have but I also don't I'm not Unlimited um all right can you bring up the deck again so we're going to talk about the deck oh yeah are you sharing your screen so we're going to talk about how cognizism can also be used in relationships so growing through those reflexive relationships we talked about so um if we imagine that the philosophy is developing reflexive relationships practices or things like identifying common ground and then also for times that we don't have common ground uh staking Divergent beliefs as claims so really taking the ego out of it and just saying like Okay if you believe this and I believe this let's make a claim about the future and then um we'll see you know what happens uh and because yeah respecting acknowledging when our beliefs has changed I think a lot of people don't realize especially people who don't think about meta thought at all they don't realize how much their beliefs are changing over time they don't know about psychology or how fallible human memory is they don't really know these things like when you remember things it actually rewrites it a little bit so people trust their memories like really really really really confidently even though they're changing all the time um and so if they're tools that are just reflecting back to people their own words because once they see it they'll remember it because it's in their own language and showing like actually you did very confidently say uh something to the contrary right and this is one of those things that was a struggle for a while with the score based systems of like prediction markets of like how do you get something to really bring something back up uh from the past uh that like well somebody wasn't listening to them in the first place um and it became like it really had to be this uh intelligence system to really make the best use of these very Dynamic and expressive different types of views um yeah so in reflexive relationship it's different than other relationships that you might have had so in a traditional Mentor mentee relationship where you are learning there's one person who's learning and one person who is her teaching in a reflexive relationship both partners are learning and adapting to each other um yeah and that comes from this place where I'm the first Manifesto is very like against hierarchy against like somebody dictating against all other reason what people are supposed to listen to uh or what you should learn I wanted to have sort of more honest and open connections with people that were I guess more colonic you know like not this power flows from the top I wanted to focus more on the relationship between the individuals so between individuals um and there was a lot in the first Manifesto two about autonomy of mind because there was a lot that I had learned about how most people not mostly was just there's so much manipulation of our Consciousness all the time like we've normalized it we live in capital Society we're literally what it's a game to advertise which is an advertisement is this game to convince you of something that you don't believe right it's like we're constantly being manipulated and your attention is constantly being mired for the profit incentive in this terrible Loop where it does not align with making your life better sometimes it kind of correlates you know like oh if Facebook advertised me a weight and I picked up the weight and now I'm A Little Bit Stronger it's like sometimes it aligns um but we see a lot of the time that this extraction of our attention is pretty unhealthy gets people in these really dark feedback loops online where it's like the reason why the algorithm is trying to show things to the users not because it's helpful it's because it needs to keep them on site or because it has some other goal for the company clicks or something and it's like as soon as you cut with algorithmic distribution as soon as you cut it apart from the actual intention of freaking helping people you're gonna get so many unexpected behaviors oh well just we'll do it by proxy well this kind of is good this kind of represents social good uh upvotes you know something like that and it's like wow why are all these feedback loops happening and these companies who are incentivized by profit uh to only make decisions relative to that uh that you know um and it's interesting because we've been talking about yeah the the platforms and things which were supposed to bring people together but are often uh creating divisions like with people and and you know putting them in screens instead of in relationships so one of the differences with this approach is that it's really about technology and being subservient to those relationships so it's really about emphasizing the relationships between people with technology playing a more supporting role but never the main thing so signals of reflexive relationships is that all about that mutual respect a value of autonomy feeling equally valued and appreciated appreciation of each other's strengths and weaknesses and feeling confident in the person's ability to support them and the technology is just about helping support that that relationship where you're both growing yeah and if if this if this gets built and it doesn't do that if people don't have this felt sense of like hey I feel like my community is getting better we're collaborating better I am seeing each other I'm not always online I'm not concerned with every single notification I'm just getting the information that is most helpful to us like it's going to show and proof of it but this is essentially the way it was thought about of trying to get away from the type of relationships we see in uh for-profit societies those type of relationships to something more like what it used to be in the tribal setting there's a lot of that in the first Manifesto about that about how we used to intermediate mediate before there was new systems to exchange with strangers like what would that mean if you scaled up language How Could You scale up language as an interface for people and um one of the reasons why this is so focused on language is just I really want people to be in the human layer I don't want you to be looking at a screen and and text itself is like the simplest thing you can get a text in the form of a text in your phone and there will be some connection to that but it's a basic very simple interface that any person a person in the tribe you know if you take an iris that speaks a different language and you bring it out into the somebody who's never spoken to anybody and you have them represent their language in a sequence of characters that make sense to them and over time you express findings between your language and their language it will learn how to express the space between you two this brand new world view out of nowhere it will learn to help uh create an undershared understanding and it's that shared understanding that comes from these tools that really helps people to see each other and not be so angry so much of interaction online is like you remove all of the context of of the person and and their beliefs and what the IRS is trying to do is bring that context back so that the way that we interface with each other is not so heated or angry or not so much about competition but it's more about like how can we interface towards uh a positive future that we share together um yeah we talked about this a little bit earlier um they provide immediate space for people to maintain privacy while sharing their perspectives um this is this idea that when the iris is saying something it's saying in its language but like it's forming from the thoughts of the people it's like some sort of hyper democracy is the best way to view it it's not good it's not really useful to frame it as some sort of danger Will Robinson I on an agent and I at least not in generative modeling like this it's not a good frame to view it that way it's more like a pool where you throw your thoughts into and it dissolves into knowledge and then recrystallizes into thought crystals that when you shine light through they make beautiful poetry like that is the that is much better lens to to view this through uh generative models um we talked about this in the beginning with the the Hegel synthesis and try the fact that it can find the spaces in between a lot of this is all me just trying to reiterate the spaces in between that we can use these tools to help uh bring people into alignment and arrange in how we're understanding the world and also respect the differences and respect that uh those differences have value over time for individuals and individual communities um and one of my one of the things that I would really love to do when I'm having an argument with people is I would love for us to just stake a difference in belief uh so they're in idea markets you can just buy a belief and a claim and your idea is that other people will believe that more in the future and so like you will get some sort of value uh in the future that's a way of tying this idea of skin in the game skin of the game can be very good uh in different contexts and I think that when I get into arguments with people I would really just like to stop it and like we have different frames okay we're not gonna we're just clashing and clashing and clashing and no matter what I say it's like we're misinterpreting each other is there a possibility for us to log some belief that we both think the outcome will express some truth about this and honor it and it should be long enough in the future that you're probably going to forget about it you know and that's a very powerful mechanism because you can come back and that temporal binding back to that moment if these are happening you know all of the time it creates a relationship between uh uh our perception that expands it outwards to take into account a longer frame of being and also a more communal frame of being like are the decisions are the thoughts that I'm making are they are how do they play out at a scale Beyond just me as an individual and um semantic Ledger is a very complex concept that I would I would need a whole session to do on this this is something that's coming in the future and we're going to release uh white paper explaining precisely everything it's basically time I think people seem to understand what we're saying um to the point um do you want to do another group question before we go into that last section I didn't know it was pretty popular so we had a couple of requests oh what were their requests just more more questions and they like the questions okay so I've uh maybe picking one of them either what's making what is it making sense so far or what do you want logical thing is a logical thing to do is to ask the community what question they want to ask that was actually their idea too so I have to learn things to ask are we seeing a yes yeah they said that they wanted to they wanted to ask a question to see what question they should ask so I think this is perfect so what isn't making sense so far in the talk oh should I ask it that way uh well I mean you can do whatever you want but the the question on the screen what isn't making sense so far in the talk do we want to go ahead and do that group see where we need some clarity I'll do two what isn't making sense so far in the group or so far in the talk and um other questions should we ass okay fine now when I've queried for I haven't queried for questions before because of the way that the The Prompt is behind there uh sometimes it just sort of still tries to summarize the views of the People based off of their question like try to make sense of what they believe because I didn't set it up specifically for this but we'll do it for fun we'll see what happens all right so you should be receiving a question what isn't making sense so far in the talk and again I know we have a few people who are still not able to use it um we can follow up with you afterwards but I think many of the people have been able to answer so you'll have three minutes so hurry up answer the question and then we have the other question what other questions should we ask everyone uh do you want to keep going through while those are coming in uh yeah talk about communism for groups hold on for a second resume [Music] okay so we'll see those pooled in a sec second yep so thinking about when you scale this up to the group uh communism is amazing because you can balance that individual freedom of expression with focusing the group attention and coordinated action which is difficult to do so we're thinking about reflexive Society we have this Collective that is actively working to improve their understanding about themselves about others and their environments and using that collective intelligence to coordinate action together so it's not a top-down approach it's emergent from the group what should be done what are the goals and then also how people think that it's best to get there and what what has shown to work in the past yeah uh the goals I think in collaboration in the community should be able to be emerging they should be sort of uh meta stable Vector of Direction um I think there are a lot of really cool projects out there that are trying to create specific factors of direction that are really important to chase that like regenerative is a regenerating the planet is a vector of direction that we want to motivate and it is a specific thing and I've uh been making irises for region Network who uh has this vision for uh you know quantifying the ecological state of the planet and sort of incentivizing actions that uh regenerate the planet now that's a very specific goal and it's something that we should be chasing but the question is okay if that takes 50 years you get to the end of that 50 years what then you know we're still in this mode where our entire Society is built around regenerating but the plan has regenerated okay that is the essential task in my heart and I also I think that if these models work well that and do what I expect in terms of like balancing the different uh voices and how well they are predicting things that it will emerge as a goal to regenerate the soil and to collaborate with each other uh to improve the health of the planet I would like to see those uh goals emerge and um it's not like there's a specific Vector of direction that is trying to encourage everybody's to specifically go in there are these things like okay how confident do you feel about certain things about certain information how does that confidence change over time how good do you feel about certain things does that change over time and that shifting pattern of belief and that shifting distribution of belief across time is what really moves and creates a uh a four Direction when there is a good energy to do that and also slows Society down if it needs to it doesn't need to just be a vector of growth right like it doesn't always need to be like we're going you know I envisioned this as a system that knows how to react to the claim the needs of the people expressing I need to log off I need to not interact with this as well I need to go outside like that is my dream of building out these tools is that this is something you that doesn't try to own your attention is this something that tries to help you it tries to help you improve your relationships with your friends it tries to help you improve your in your life it tries to reflect back to you it tries to be what a good friend is and then show you when you've said dumb stuff without making you feel angry because why can't you can feel angry at something it has there's nothing behind it but just words trying to help you and those words you know come from the community itself so all right so we have about 15 minutes left and it looks like we have consensus come that's coming in so if you're in the Discord you're able to see that um it looks like the consensus for that first question so what isn't making sense so far in the talk majority of the questions sent around how to use Iris and what resources are available people want to experiment with the tool but don't know where to start art there is a sense that this tool is crucial to cultivate and spread but there's uncertainty about how best to do so um and then the next one is the answers to the question so that they're for the what else other questions uh most people are most curious about how Iris will be used in the future and what its implications are people want to know if ours can be trusted and if it is really necessary there's some kind of concerns about whether the opinions by complete Rock balloons will be unjustly excluded that's a great question uh is that what the original the or won't be unjustly because here's the thing and the cognosis frame everybody has the right to be heard but not everybody has the right to be Amplified okay you can say stuff and you can know that the iris is listening and trying to make sense of what you're saying but if you say it a billion times that's not gonna do dude in fact that could really hurt you if you just keep repeating the same thing and in the in many different like ways and in the future it's just really clear that you're off I mean it'll keep listening and if you start talking about something else it's gonna listen to you it's not gonna permanently it's not like even Banning you permanently it's just Banning you in a context of like you're freaking annoying people about the specific thing you're not helping anybody I'm listening to you but they don't need to hear you if you are right in the future that is on record if everything turns the future and you're a whack alone and you're being called a Lackland and it's proven far in the future that you are not a wacolin you're still on record but you didn't hurt people in that moment by like just your passion and exuberance for your confidence which a lot of whack balloons do they need to be heard and so the Iris will reflect back okay this is what you're saying to me and they will feel heard because they will know that the iris is understanding their view but it's not gonna amplify them unless the the view is helping people in some way and um of course anybody can make an iris you know that's my dream and the vision of it there's also so let's go back to so I did I did a reading on some of these um the main certainties revolve around how the application of cognizism will be learned and the trustee worthiness of virus absolutely people who are seeking more information about what resources are available to learn from as well as deployment deals with practice it's distribution about whether the iris is an aggregator or not I view it as absolutely aggregated aggregator um of perceptions into a single form that people can make sense of um I think that uh you know I want people to play with their own fine-tuned models and see themselves in it right when you start writing in your Journal and you see it reflecting back ideas you say like that's me it's not sentient being on it just freaking me it's a mirror I'm talking to a mirror oh Jesus Christ I gave my mirror memory and now I'm talking to it and that's great that's really really powerful thing um but that's I think the trust has to come from the trust with your community and what's going into the iris right um somebody's gonna be building it somebody's going to be maintaining it and uh I think that the ideal vision is that people maintain it I'm big on the idea of like a hollow chain is an idea and like uh the idea that people are controlling their own data and things like that my main interest is just getting right now the frame of collective intelligence into that suggests that there are ways to do this really well um but also not necessarily try to dictate to everybody you have to do it this way just just pay attention to a bit to these these models and try to think about how they can help people instead of hurt people because obviously there's a lot of ways that they can hurt people and obviously there are people in power who are using them already to hurt people and that is why I decided to train the models because I was informed that people with nefarious intent were training at these models they were fine-tuning them on their views they wanted that to use them as propaganda Bots that were essentially the ultimate convincers you know the ultimate salesman though they sought you out and convinced you of whatever view it was and I'm like My ultimate fear that I wrote about over and over again it's literally happening and if I don't do it's uh you know so I started trying to show the potential of it I think you should be wearing I think you should think actively about it in regards to wanting to do it yourself it's actually very easy on open AI anybody can get an account and you can talk to Da Vinci which is just a generic one there is also a very simple mechanism called fine tuning I'll post about it in the the server where you can do it manually I'm also building tools through the Discord to collaboratively train these models into Forum Community I'm working on actively regen network is helping fund that work um so it's a playground it's a garden I'm growing things I'm testing them and experimenting uh for the first time live after seeing a grand vision of what was going to come now I'm here it's here I'm I'm seeing what I can do based off of what I remember from all of that time I would love to have all of you contributing in that conversation asking those questions of uncertainty in this Iris coming back to this server sharing those things so that we can work through those details and I can explain to you uh just how much I thought about these questions um and just how much the iris too has also learned about the answer the these questions right now this iris is a very generic Iris just for summer it's not trained on cognizism or my particular views because then it'll start talking about it with that lens just like if I use the region that we're on it's going to start talking about regenerating the planet more right and just like if you have your own want Iris it's going to start talking about like the idea of Market one it's going to start talking about ideal markets all the time um but it still has access to the entirety of knowledge that is then it has been trained on so it's a focused lens that can pull from human knowledge uh in contextualize that knowledge so we've shared a lot we have about seven minutes left in the session so do we want to open it up for questions from the group yeah voice voice questions not Irish questions Peter could you just like uh media how it traditionally goes yeah I'm gonna stop uh the share uh so thank you John for um sharing all that and uh I haven't been following the shots uh at all but maybe we can sneak in one or two um anyone uh maybe put a emoticon hand up if you have a something or plus one question in the chat Kevin Delaine uh hey John hey I'm wondering um I posted this in the chat a few times I'm sure you know the story of Microsoft's Tay yeah uh the Twitter bot who became a Nazi yeah 24 hours and just posted you know like oh all feminists should die and burn in hell Hitler is right I hate the Jews sorry that's yeah yeah what the bot says um I wonder like how you like how you learn from that or like if you have anything to like deal with yeah uh maybe like I don't know maybe maybe trolls I'm not sure I'm not sure yes no no it's a great question and that's basically what is bound to happen when you have this open latent space where there's no accounting to the source that is you know adjusting the training data you just throw all these voices blandly together and just hope what happens and before GPT existed and I was seeing these language models come out I was like you cannot just throw all this language into the same box like that and there's always there's going to be problems if you just open up the training like that there is a thing within real irises which is my dream of the proper architecture I would I would need more resources to like really be able to experiment with it but it has something called there are two things called The Source embedding and the The Source distribution I talked about that a little bit more which is that it is trying to learn over time which voices are relevant in which context and how much to amplify them and is doing that based off of a history of those claims so if you have a lot of new accounts like if you try to do like a civil of meaning right they don't really have much weight to the iris they're brand new they have no there's nothing in contextualized to the iris to make sense it has no reason to weight those voices what was that someone's making some noise yeah uh yeah there's no reason uh for the model to weight those voices as having any particular value and so it is going to be like what a human would do which is very hesitant to bring that into that main space and have those uh thoughts affect the collective decision making because there's no history of it um those two things do two two really interesting things the source and betting allows for uh any thought that you write to be interpreted in the context of your past claims meaning if two different people write the same sentence it means something different depending on who said it it really does there's a context to who they are and what they mean by what they mean and so that was a big problem I was trying to solve when I was thinking about prediction markets like people's interpreting these things very very very very differently so that's a combination of these two elements in the neural architecture or the model architecture called The Source embedding and the source attention distribution which together do we uh a job of learning to to not amplify the trolls to hear the trolls but not amplify them interesting so when you say like for example the same sentence two people say um will mean different things I'm wondering how that could be used for say like sarcasm because like saying oh I go uh Universal Health Care is a great idea it could you know could mean something exactly that thing whereas that the context the semantic temporal context meaning like the other surrounding thoughts the surrounding conversations of claims and predictions that people are saying in that space affects the interpretation of that claim and we can use that information dynamically and easily it's not something that you have to magically pull in it's just it's just that's what the model does that's what it's supposed to do that's his job that's all it does yeah thanks Kevin um I'm cool to stay five minutes after the bottom but then I'll have to close it down the field uh one or two more questions John yeah cool uh Melissa you got your hand up hi um I I want to say I had kind of a random question um but I don't know if random really exists in this context anymore um I was wondering to John that I just had like a I imagined this being used potentially not really technically used in a a jury situation where um you know like in a trial they collect the information people think about it I wonder I'll just let what that implies you can react yes I have envisioned when I think about these tools and I think about the entire democratic system is built around text it is built around languages around the recording of language and therefore it can be reinvented using those tools I do know that there is this fundamental problem with the legal system which is that you can buy a better lawyer and some lawyers are better at using words there's some lawyers are better at convincing other people and you know I have songs about this that I've written that are just very like this is how can we even pretend that this is Justice when it's literally the function of you know how much money you you have is so correlated to [Music] um whether you get off on very specific things there's lots of Trends about wealth that somebody might come afterwards and the judicial system to contextualize that but and it's very complex but the point being yes that uh there is a lot of bias introduced into uh those systems uh but also like I a big thing in the manifesto is like I don't like Arbiters of Truth I don't like one person or one thing declaring what what anything is that's why this is a multi-irous vision like many different perspectives I it would scare the hell out of me if somebody said I'm gonna build the one true Iris I believe I have up really bad I have screwed up because I don't view the world that's like not it's like the anti-cognizant is like to be like there is one true truth one true declare um so in that context I'm like juries in a way might be a way to take that into redesign and I'm sure lots of people will think about that redesign in that way but in all of these tread lightly you know and log your expectations log what you think is going to happen because if you screw up you I think you should be accountable to whatever design that you're putting into the world certainly I'm trying and willing to be accountable to the world to like these ideas that I'm trying to put into the world I think we might have uh just enough time for a Stephanie's question then we'll need to end ah cool hi wow okay mind blown I I I like don't even know which question to ask but and and I'm actually kind of embarrassed about the one that feels like it wants to come forth but um yeah as someone who spends a lot of time thinking about synthesis and how to integrate different perspectives I mean I was literally just writing something about that today it is something I think about a lot I just like I mean I don't know I don't know how to ask it other than like what do we need us for anymore or like what what what like you know is like how yeah and I and I understand that we're gonna co-evolve here so like um you know who knows so but yeah yeah does a lot of this type of work thank you Chris sorry go ahead because she's she does a lot of this type of work for this exact same thing and she often helps me as like this human Iris that is helping process this type of information and doing exactly this it's just I want to get our focuses back to being human and creating for joy and and doing things not because it's a grind not because it's a job but because we're actually allocating resources effectively and attention effectively uh to the problems that are emerging in a way that allows us to have the space to explore ourselves I we talk about hierarchy a little bit but I really do not like the idea of selling your autonomy as a job there's something highly disturbing about it to me and the concept of saying like I no longer have autonomy between these period this period of time or at least my autonomy is limited to this time and you're going to give me money for that there's something very dystopian about that to me um so yeah what do we need to do you need to spend time with people you need to do things that you enjoy you need to experience the world you need to create things that excite you and you need to identify when there are problems need to be fixed and like help solve them and do fun things make new Services you start a restaurant like but not everything has to be through the lens of will this make money there are other ways to coordinate and organize together to do fun cool stuff and what I'm saying is if we tried to play together in this semantic Leisure that the types of ways that we could play together could be a lot more supportive to our who we are as beings and not a lot less disaligned and the reason why is because I think money is a very low representation of well-being one bit if you just expand that out to the resolution of the semantic Ledger it will capture humanity and reflect it a lot better like Society reflects the system more than it reflects Society more because because it's so low resolution and if we can just add a little bit of resolution I I think that we can have our society reflect what it means to be human and not what it means to be whatever ISM I do not want the society to make what it reflects to be a cognitive I want to reflect just what it means to be a human in different localities not one true human just like where you are who you're connected to what does that mean for you thank you yeah reflect and and enable the continual Evolution up it's like we don't even know who we are yet I'm just in the process of discovery well thank you thank you yeah awesome thank you Stephanie um so we'll gently close here uh John awesome job thank you for coming to the stove today for presenting Iris let's give them a round of applause thank you so much uh thank you deepaks for uh helping us out today as well and for people watching uh on the video um any words you'd like to leave them uh John like perhaps how they can find the Discord if that's going to be like them um I would the main place to reach me is on Twitter because I'm a very public facing with ideas about systems change I think that that work should be done in the public so at Speaker John Ash um and I can you can reach out to me for an invite to the server the service so nascent it's like really like very very Cutting Edge so I'm just trying to keep it uh to to people who are you know not going to come in and just try to break it you know with like sex or violence or whatever it is I'm just trying to be like yeah there's going to be bugs like this isn't a real Iris if somebody talks too much it's gonna be Amplified more that's and that's not what I want it to do so we're just playing um but yeah you can reach out to me on that um which is also at cognizist Iris which is another Twitter account which I I have a main Iris that puts out wisdom related to cognizism um and then there's also HTTP not s because it's on AWS something it doesn't matter purple pill dot vision is a recent document that we wrote that sort of explains the idea of of the iris there's another stoa talk that we did that Daniel mediated that uh you know he talks so good he talks so pretty he explains it so well so you should check that out too um and and thank you for sharing the space and thank you for for deep packs um I'm very grateful for just the opportunity to be able to speak about these ideas I I really think that if we reframe a little bit about where we're heading we could get back to being human [Music] yeah and I'll put uh some of those links on the video notes and John you're doing some great work this is uh I feel a lot of potential with this Iris thing so keep it up and uh John everyone thanks so much for coming to snow today yeah thank you so much\"\nVideo Summary:"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "INTRODUCTION\nWith a growing suite of advancing and emerging technologies coming together in all areas of our economy, the need to make sense of disparate data has never been greater. The convergence of autonomous vehicles, drones and bots, IoT sensors, XR, sovereign identity, digital transactions, 5G, and the need for an artificial intelligence system that can safely orchestrate all their activities necessitates new technologies and protocols.  An integrated operational framework and system is needed to contextualize, synchronize and make interoperable these disparate data sources about people, places, assets and vehicles.\nTHE COMPANY\nVERSES provides a next-generation AI-based contextual computing operating system based on the Spatial Web standards (see below and IEEE WG P2874).  The most urgent and difficult problem in computing is poor interoperability between software and hardware. It is necessary to integrate these disparate but increasingly mutually reliant technologies into a unified and cohesive network for an information exchange that is as coherent with our logical understanding of the world as it is with the physical features of the world. There are four main challenges:\nThe context challenge of inter-networking functionalities and data between humans, machines, as well as objects, and the heterogeneous and siloed systems operating them.\nThe spatial challenge of delineating and coordinating the activities between humans, machines, and objects in a multidimensional way (3D, 4D, cost, temp, safety etc…).\nThe operational challenge of synchronizing the flow of information and activities across spaces, humans, machines, and objects.\nThe legislative challenge of creating and maintaining digital versions of policies and legislations and making them machine-readable, machine sharable and machine-executable.\n\nNEW SPATIAL WEB STANDARDS \nThe above challenges (contextual, spatial, operational and legislative) can be properly addressed using a new standard protocol that allows people, places and things to communicate: (1) a common language that models spatial or hyperdimensional relationships, and (2) a contracting protocol that queries that language and sends and receives the common language’s data.  These standards have been developed by the Spatial Web Foundation and are in the course of being standardized within the IEEE WG P2874, namely: \nHSML - Hyperspace Modeling Language\nA common data model that enables adaptive intelligence at scale.\nA standard that articulates the types of relationships which can exist between any base elements and their purpose.\nHSTP - Hyperspace Transaction Protocol\nMulti-dimensional range query.\nGoverns interactions between parties to ensure privacy and security.\nThe IEEE considers HSML and HSTP a “Public Imperative”, a designation typically reserved for critical public infrastructure like nuclear energy, smart grids, and voting machines.\nA unified operating system, developed by VERSES, was built upon HSML and HSTP. It allows for the deployment of artificial intelligence applications in a way that addresses the contextual, spatial, and operational challenges.\nTHE CONTEXT CHALLENGE > CONTEXT AUGMENTS DATA FOR AIs\nThe world is overflowing with data, yet AI seems to be hitting a glass ceiling in terms of performance, relevance and explainability. This issue can be summarized as a challenge in context-making. Data is currently out of context, and it needs to be put into context. “Context” in this instance is the semantic, societal, situational, and environmental meta-data model about the activities of people, places and things over time. Context needs to be shared between networks of heterogeneous devices and applications empowering them to proactively offer enriched, situation-aware and usable content, instructions and experiences.\nContext is made up of the elements of relationships that define the entities, objects, locations and actions—commonly known as the Who, What, When, Where, How and Why of any scenario, contract or circumstance. The Spatial Web Foundation defined a context graph (HSML—see also below) that describes the relationships between these different context elements. In turn, the context-aware computing developed by VERSES (COSM operating system) enables increasing degrees of insight from the contextualized data. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPATIAL CHALLENGE > SPATIAL DOMAINS AUGMENT DIGITAL TWINS\n\n3.1. Spatial Domains\nSpatial Domains are digital titles linked to 3D volumetric locations such as buildings, ports, streets, or larger regions, such as cities, states, continents and trading blocs. Spatial subdomains represent subspaces that have a holonic structure, which allows for the orchestration of hierarchical rights and policies.\nSpatial domains enable secure management of digitally mediated rights and permissions for:\nWho/what is authorized to access the domain.\nWhat content or data is available to view.\nWho can publish and modify content.\nWho can transact or interact with it.\n\nOne key piece of information maintained by the spatial domain is the 3D model itself.  This 3D model contains all the geometries, addresses, appropriate routes, location of IoT devices, and any subdomains.  The 3D model is dynamic and can be updated in real-time as local conditions change.\nSpatial Domains contain all the rules, rights, permissions, fees, 3D models, IoT devices, network access, etc. associated with a geospatial region as defined by their owner or authority. This results in a governance layer of geospatial information written in HSML that can be queried by agents as they approach and move through them. They also can be queried remotely, allowing AIs to assist in deciding the optimal route or best way to complete operations and transactions based on the domain's restrictions.\nSpatial domains use a holonic architecture, i.e., nested spatial domains, or holons, that inherit the rules above them and pass their rules to the ones below them.  For example, federal laws are usually applicable to states or provinces, however the local authorities will apply their own local ordinances as well. \n3.2. Spatial or Multidimensional Range Queries \nIn order for autonomous drones and vehicles to operate, and for AI to orchestrate their activities, a query method is required to gather all the data necessary from disparate sources; we call this system the Spatial DNS (sDNS).  \nSpatial DNS (nDimensional Range Query) & HSTP \nThe sDNS allows actors to request information via HSTP (Hyperspatial Transaction Protocol), such as:\nWhere can I go?\nHow should I go there?\nWhat can I do?\nWhat credentials do I need?\nWhat are the weather conditions there?\nWhat are the costs?\nH3 Geospatial Index\nTo query spatial domains, the actor or agent defines the geospatial area of interest using a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) called H3.  H3 allows for any geospatial shape to be queried on earth, resulting in an index of associated domains with very little latency.  These domains then can be queried further to discover their rules or data needed to carry out an operation. \n\nTHE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGE > COSM, AN AI-BASED CONTEXT COMPUTING PLATFORM\n4.1. Context Awareness\nVERSES’ flagship offering, COSM™ (Context-aware Open Service Mesh), is an Artificial Intelligence Operating System built upon the open protocols HSML and HSTP for managing resources and deploying AI applications on the Spatial Web. Its five Flow Modules are designed to address the requirements for a universal network of humans, machines, and AI. COSM™ contextualizes spatial relationships according to Spatial Domains through a Spatial Domain Name Service (SDNS) that organizes and allows for the management of policies and permissions.\nCOSM™ addresses the above requirements:\nIO-Flow (Communication): Interface agent. Management of connected devices to publish sensor data and instruct machines and humans to perform tasks.\nData-Flow (Interoperability): Context mapping. Normalization and correlation of data from disparate systems into a unified coherent HSML Context Graph™.\nDomain-Flow (Trust): Rule configuration. Definition of the policies, permissions, and credentials that govern the interactions of all actors on the Spatial Web.\nSim-Flow (Adaptability): Goal simulation. Simulation of goal-based optimizations based on requirements or restrictions, and recommendation of tasks to achieve ideal states.\nWork-Flow (Execution): Task engine. Delegation of optimization tasks to a connected workforce of humans, autonomous vehicles, and/or bots.  \nAll data coming from and to the IoT sensors will be converted into HSML the lingua franca of the digital twin, normalizing all its information. HSML is the language of the actor and its twin; it describes all operations and activities within either a COSM operating system or other OS utilizing HSML.\nUsing COSM offers the following capabilities:\nNew data meta-models and communication protocols that define a common method to describe, express, share, and update context between all the edges of a network. Context in this instance is the semantic, societal, situational, and environmental meta-data model about people, places, and things over time.\nContext is shared between networks of heterogeneous devices and applications, empowering them to proactively offer enriched, situation-aware, and usable content, instructions and experiences—like a situational communal garden of context information if you will.\nCOSM allows context to:\nBe stateful.\nBe machine-readable and executable.\nBe shareable between heterogeneous networks, devices and applications.\nMaintain coherence over time and space for all the actors/edges involved in a use case.\nThese new meta-models support context-aware applications that, in turn, are able to support interoperable, cross-platform networking between disparate hardware (e.g., autonomous drones, sensors, smart devices, robots) and software systems (e.g., enterprise services, cloud platforms, mobile applications, artificial intelligence) across different vendors and suppliers.\nThe challenges in modeling context are linked to—and not limited to—a set of constraints: they need to represent the relationship between the identity of the actor, the scope and authorization of his permissioned activities, and the place and time where they may happen. COSM coherently describes and maintains the where and when of any scenario (dimensions, space, time and channel), the why and how (i.e., conditions or governance—right, credential, claim and activity), and the who and what—i.e., objects—authority, domain, actor and asset).\nCOSM allows to orchestrate AIs that run on the same coherent context model, therefore compounding/allowing AIs to compete on the same data formats, in order to derive more relevant, more accurate, and more explainable simulations and recommendations.\nCOSM’s distributed holonic architecture enables AIs designed for specific optimized functions. It does so by ingesting and sharing data with other micro- & macro-COSMs above and below it, therefore providing the specific curated and normalized data required to efficiently perform their function. This type of holonic structure mirrors the neural network of the brain.   \nVERSES’ TIPS (Trust, Interoperability, Privacy, and Security) framework allows for the secure and privacy-preserving governance of people, places and things. This is not possible without having a network that is context-aware.\n\n4.2. Autonomous interoperability and internetworking edges\nAll autonomous actors on the network need to be aware of the other actors, their route, tasks, credentials, capabilities, sensors, etc.  This will enable actors to coordinate activities, work as swarms, alert each other to danger, and even share their sensor data with others on the network.  \nIn order to reach L5 autonomous driving, an interoperability system such as this needs to exist.  Without this capability all these actors will operate as independent nodes, working on their own without awareness or coordination of the others, which is the current state of autonomous vehicles.  \nVehicle capabilities\nA profile of the vehicle or drone and all its capabilities and limitations needs to be known in order for the system to assign the most optimal and safe route and coordinate its activities with other actors.  For example, how fast can a drone safely operate, under what weather conditions and carrying how much weight?\n\nVehicle digital twin\nEach vehicle is represented as a digital twin, cataloging and registering its many sensors into a single model.  This will allow the vehicle to act as a single organism, fusing all its sensors together.  The digital twin will allow for its authority to access and control all aspects of its sensors.  When a new IoT sensor is introduced to the vehicle, say a phone or a new camera, the vehicle’s actor detects its presence VIA bluetooth, and inspects its smart wallet to determine its credentials, capabilities, network and power requirements.  If the authority grants it access, it registers it into the digital twin and adds it to the sensor fusion model.  \n\nTHE POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE CHALLENGE > HOW TO MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE POLICIES THAT CAN BE INTERPRETED AND SHARED BY MACHINES AND HUMANS\n5.1. From analog policies to digital law\nExisting regulation has been drafted traditionally by humans and for humans, but with little regard for interpretability and  executability by a machine. There is tremendous value in seeking to bridge the gap between the traditional way of drafting and publishing regulation (i.e., by humans for humans) and having machine-readable and machine-executable regulation (i.e., by humans, for machines) especially in the context of autonomous mobility scenarios.\nTranslating existing regulation into machine-interpretable  and machine-executable code will allow us to properly capture how humans read and interpret the regulation,  and, when technology fails to do so, to develop an alternative that is technically feasible and can be acceptable for human  regulators. More generally, the challenge is to discover where and why technology can replace humans when it comes to interpretation, and where and why not.\nFurthermore, harmonized liability rules (for drones for example) are lacking at the EU level. Consequently, liability law is governed by the  traditional rules at the national (Member State) level. An innovation, therefore, lies in (1) the development of liability rules that are  (2) machine-interpretable and machine-executable. Finally, regulation is subject to change, and it is often multi-layered, meaning  that regulatory bodies at different levels (e.g., EU level, state level, municipality level, company level) jointly contribute to a specific  type of regulation. As a result, different pieces of regulation may consist of different languages. To make a regulation machine interpretable and machine-executable, and to make any interpretation model scalable, a semantic representation needs to be  available that accommodates regulatory changes and regulation at different levels and in different languages. The technological  challenge lies in developing a suitable semantic representation.\nVERSES developed automated tools with COSM and HSML for governing actions within the domain of Urban Air Mobility to enforce rules and policies systematically. Our solution allows current laws to be parsed into machine-readable models and interpreted programmatically, reducing the human interpretation of laws and guidelines into more binary statements. Our developed technology takes the legal text and constructs ontologies and context from automated Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methodologies. These are then used to construct machine-readable representations of specific legal scenarios. This information is then parsed into HSML, where it is combined with other sources of information (such as IoT devices, user input, cameras, drones, etc.).\nSeveral laws that have been converted into HSML have been tested in real-world flight environments, including rules about dynamically changing variables. We translated existing EU laws for Urban Air Mobility into HSML, ensuring that the proposed actions and flight plans automatically conform to the set of parsed rules and regulations at play:\nWe ensured that HSML could accommodate the vast array of prohibitive and deontic laws found in the EU literature.\nWe worked with legal experts to ensure that the assumptions made during the translation process abide by existing interpretations of the relevant laws.\nWe worked to provide a mechanism for suggesting legal innovations when a machine-readable format cannot straightforwardly accommodate the ambiguity of laws.\n5.2. Promises and challenges\nHSML allows the evaluation of  counterfactual actions - what would happen if someone were to perform a certain activity? We can use this to perform (abstract) routing - find (optimal) series of legal activities that get from HSML graph A to HSML graph B\nHSML is updated from a range of real-time data sources; it allows autonomous agents to dynamically operate within the confines of the law. If there is a law about maximum wind speed, and dynamically update the route given changing wind-speed conditions\nHSML can be extended beyond laws - any “rules of the games” can be constructed and abided by using the same schemas and systems\nThe law is inherently ambiguous and generally applied to humans (“UA operators must fly safely” - how do you define “safely”? Can AI operate safer than humans?). HSML can help automatically identify ambiguous laws and can provide a feedback mechanism for developing future analog laws with machine readability in mind. This can be the foundation for a virtuous two-way loop between analog law and digital law.\n\nA multi-sensor, AI-observed and operated transportation system would be able to analyze and measure the effectiveness and downsides of current legislation and infrastructure.  By modeling the existing laws and infrastructure, AI can run virtually infinite simulations, determining the optimal balance of efficiency and risk and thereby providing recommendations to legislators how best to adjust the laws and infrastructure in the real world.\nFLYING FORWARD 2020\n\nFlying Forward 2020: supporting the future of UAM with COSM’s geospatial governance capabilities and sensor fusion\nFlying Forward is a 3-year collaborative research project to develop a new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) ecosystem by incorporating UAM within a geospatial data infrastructure of cities. COSM is at the heart of that new infrastructure. COSM uses sensor fusion to provide the capabilities to govern the behavior of autonomous drones flying in urban areas. That involves integrating legal and spatial policies in the simulation and activation of the scenarios, while for example allowing for dynamic (re)routing, multi-party interoperability and managing landing zones.\nThe FF2020 demonstrators cover 5 use cases :\nSecurity and surveillance\nInfrastructure inspection\nAsset deliveries\nCrowd management\nEmergency deliveries.\n\nIn these scenarios, VERSES goes beyond Device Identification and Profile Authentication to make devices become Policy-aware and Location-aware. As a result, physical activities of IoT devices can be governed and enforceable at the hardware level.\nCOSM can, for example, create and manage flight corridors and no-fly zones across the city and around buildings, delivering everything from humans, packaging and surveillance. Other capabilities include Geofencing, waypoints planning, dynamic routing, object/people detection, video streaming, missions management, portal and app solution, human control, and much more.\nCOSM allows interoperability between all the edges and systems involved in the use cases and in particular allows the behavior of an,y “thing” (drone, car, truck, vessel…) to be law-abiding and adaptive in real-time to policy changes and updates\n\n\nMOBILITY USE CASES\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of examples VERSES and the Spatial Web are exploring with industry leaders and regulators.\n\nCommon shared understanding of the world\nWe believe that regulators and transportation authorities should assist in the creation of a global transportation digital twin, comprising all the local laws and rules digitally represented, machine-readable and queryable using spatial DNS (sDNS).\nCurrently, every car company must research, build and maintain their own model of the world’s laws and rules.  This is a huge expense and liability to the company and greatly hinders advancement as well as serving as a significant barrier to entry for startups.  Furthermore, since each company has their own siloed view of the world, true interoperability and shared understanding will never be possible and therefore L5 autonomy will be even more difficult to achieve.  \nSuch as system would enable independent simulators to have an accurate model of the world’s laws greatly increasing their efficacy.\nStreet sign database\nCurrently, vehicles can have a hard time recognizing the countless variations of international street signs.   A public and queryable database of all street signs and their meaning is needed to ensure safety. Furthermore, the spatial location of each sign and its jurisdiction needs to be registered so that ideally vehicles are aware of the rules of the road without the need to read the sign in the first place.\nCongestion, Routing, sequencing and optimization \nBy all actors anonymously sharing their routes and destinations, local and regional AI systems will be able to orchestrate their travel.  We envision this to be managed in a holonic method, organizing actors into groups of regional, city and local swarms.   First, the system would group an actor with other local actors into tight swarms of vehicles going in the same direction, splitting them off to join other swarms when needed to reach their destination.  Agents going cross town will be coordinated into trains of vehicles with gaps appropriately spaced to allow for other swarms to cross through them at intersections without having to come to a stop.  Swarms covering regional distances will be grouped into even larger swarms, acting like a bike peloton, reducing air friction and energy costs.  Vehicles can be moved through the swarm to mitigate their energy output, ensuring every vehicle can maximize its chance of reaching its destination without having to stop for recharging.  \nIntersections and air flight corridors\nAs vehicles approach highly congested road intersections or flight corridors, an AI for these spaces will be alerted of their presence and intention.  This hyper-localized AI will be responsible for the coordination and optimization of all vehicles in its domain as they traverse the space, effectively taking operational control until the vehicle is safely through the space whereby it will release control back to the agent and system to continue on its journey. \n\nEvery intersection and flight corridor is unique and has its own set of challenges and risks.  By modeling and analyzing the infrastructure, traffic flows and safety, the AI will be able to determine the optimal operational efficiency of each spatial domain and orchestrate all vehicles moving through it.  This is Urban Air planning and the foundation for augmenting Air Traffic Management solutions. \nCharging, energy and carbon reporting \nElectrical charging stations should report the associated carbon cost and help mitigate the cost with carbon offsets.  Energy used should be attributed to each actor and their route so the climate domain can get an accurate climate accounting of all transportation costs.   \nParking, landing zones and charging stations\nCars and drones looking for a place to park, land and re-charge will be able to query the network and find available space and services.  Depending on the settings of its authority it will decide the best place based on price, location and urgency.   All fees and transactions will be automatically managed by all the actor’s smart wallets, including the vehicle and space.  For example, the parking garage or charging station will have a smart wallet to facilitate all transactions.  See Smart Wallet below.  \nTransactions, fees, tolls, parking, charging\nTolls, fees, parking, charging costs, all these transactions should be seamless and frictionless, happening in the background and managed by a smart wallet.  Agents should be able to set their preferences, choosing to pay more for premium services or less if on a budget.  \nWeather and pollution\nIoT sensors already blanket urban spaces capturing atmospheric data.  Actors need to be able to access this data to be able to make decisions on hazards or weather conditions. \nConstruction\nMunicipalities publishing their construction schedules and IoT-enabled work crews will be able to update the network of all closed or reduced capacity areas, optimizing the rerouting or coordination of traffic as it moves through congested zones.  \nObstacle avoidance\nAutonomous vehicles will constantly be requesting the latest model of the local environment for the most up-to-date digital twin.  If it detects any new unexpected obstacles, like deer in the road, it will update the local digital twin of the environment and and alert all oncoming traffic of the new ephemeral risk.   When the deer finally moves on and is out of view, the passing cars will automatically update the local digital twin to its prior state.  \nBikes & scooters\nIn the future other modes of transportation like bikes, scooters and the like could be included in the network if their navigation system or the passenger’s smart app was registered as an actor in the system.   \nVehicles not on the system\nFor legacy cars not registered in the network, driving apps like Wayz or Google Maps could be utilized to register the car and its route, informing the driver of the optimal route and speed at which they should drive to keep pace with the swarm, timing all the lights and intersections and be altered to dangers.  The vehicle’s IoT sensors or cameras can still be registered and accessed by the system.   Other autonomous cars on the system would be aware of the unregistered car and its route, providing a little extra buffer to make allowances for the human operator.  \nCars completely off the network and not utilizing a driving app would be out on their own, but provided the driver was savvy they ought to be able to follow along with the swarm and stay in cadence.  Autonomous vehicles would be able to identify the car as out of network and make allowances to maintain safe travel.  \nMaaS \nWorking across local, regional, national and international levels, a MaaS network can see the entire transportation graph, query it, determine the optimal route, sequence and transportation mode, make reservations and facilitate it into a single transaction.  Cameras located on and inside the vehicle will be able to identify customers and passengers while protecting their identity us the TIPS (Trust, Interoperability, Privacy & Security) framework.  \nFirst responders and safety\nPolice and fire departments responding to emergencies will automatically be provided the right of way with the system prioritizing their route and pausing all other swarms and vehicles.  Swarms and vehicles will be routed around traffic stops, accidents, fires etc to ensure the flow of traffic ensues.  \nWhen accidents or fires are reported, the emergency response domain should be able anonymously to access any cameras or sensors in the vicinity to remotely get real-time information about the conditions and respond accordingly. \nWhen emergency calls for fires or accidents occur, a drone should be automatically dispatched to the scene, providing key live insights to first responders about the current situation, how to approach and whether it should they send for backup.  \nLighting\nAll lights on the network would be made aware of vehicles, bots and swarms, ensuring to keep their way properly lit at night and turned off to conserve energy when they are not.  Unregistered vehicles, bicycles, people etc can still activate the lights by means of motion detectors, computer vision and mobile apps.  \nEntertainment and marketing\nWhether riding with a friend or using a ride-sharing service, the system should anonymously recognize each individual and be able to seamlessly access their entertainment preferences, giving them direct access to their media accounts and applications.  \nRide-sharing services can provide discounted services in exchange for targeted marketing opportunities to their captive audiences.  \nInsurance\nWhen actors declare and register their route, it can be published to a real-time insurance market where insurance providers will be able to bid their services.  By utilizing anonymous certificates, actors will be able to share their risk profile and operating history without compromising their identity. Using a real-time insurance marketplace, actors will be able to select their preferred coverage based on price, local laws and service.   AI agents representing the vehicle's authority and the insurer will be able automatically to complete the transaction and ensure coverage. \n\nsDNS Public Utility\nWe consider the need for such a queryable spatial DNS (sDNS) to be a requirement for L5 autonomy.   The sDNS is a public imperative and should be run like a public utility, allowing for any certified actor to access the system, request the data needed to safely achieve their desired goals and anonymously report back to the system.  It should be overseen by an intenational standards body (such as the Spatial Web Foundation & IEEE) comprised of industry and government organizations with input from citizens and watchdogs.  It should strive for interoperablity so that all vehicles, anywhere in the world can safely and securely operate on it’s network.  As this network of vehicles, IoT devices, cameras and operators expands, it becomes a sprawling sensor fusion and data mesh, enabling actors, authorities and AI to access information privately and securely to more efficiently and safely manage operations across even greater heterogeneous data sources and industry domains. \nSUMMARY\n\nCOSM allows for systems to share a more complete and coherent understanding of activities and continuously self-optimize, there are several fundamental requirements that build upon each other:\nCommunication: a common query language in which to interface\nInteroperability: a common data model in which to map context\nTrust: verifiable data lineage, credentials, and governance\nAdaptability: flexible logic to simulate and adjust\nExecution: ability to orchestrate tasks and resources\n\nVERSES is a company that provides a next-generation AI-based contextual computing operating system based on the Spatial Web standards.

The convergence of autonomous vehicles, drones and bots, IoT sensors, XR, sovereign identity, digital transactions, 5G, and the need for an artificial intelligence system that can safely orchestrate all their activities necessitates new technologies and protocols.  An integrated operational framework and system is needed to contextualize, synchronize and make interoperable these disparate data sources about people, places, assets and vehicles.\nTHE COMPANY\nVERSES provides a next-generation AI-based contextual computing operating system based on the Spatial Web standards (see below and IEEE WG P2874).  The most urgent and difficult problem in computing is poor interoperability between software and hardware. It is necessary to integrate these disparate but increasingly mutually reliant technologies into a unified and cohesive network for an information exchange that is as coherent with our logical understanding of the world as it is with the physical features of the world. There are four main challenges:\nThe context challenge of inter-networking functionalities and data between humans, machines, as well as objects, and the heterogeneous and siloed systems operating them.\nThe spatial challenge of delineating and coordinating the activities between humans, machines, and objects in a multidimensional way (3D, 4D, cost, temp, safety etc…).\nThe operational challenge of synchronizing the flow of information and activities across spaces, humans, machines, and objects.\nThe legislative challenge of creating and maintaining digital versions of policies and legislations and making them machine-readable, machine sharable and machine-executable.\n\nNEW SPATIAL WEB STANDARDS \nThe above challenges (contextual, spatial, operational and legislative) can be properly addressed using a new standard protocol that allows people, places and things to communicate: (1) a common language that models spatial or hyperdimensional relationships, and (2) a contracting protocol that queries that language and sends and receives the common language’s data.  These standards have been developed by the Spatial Web Foundation and are in the course of being standardized within the IEEE WG P2874, namely: \nHSML - Hyperspace Modeling Language\nA common data model that enables adaptive intelligence at scale.\nA standard that articulates the types of relationships which can exist between any base elements and their purpose.\nHSTP - Hyperspace Transaction Protocol\nMulti-dimensional range query.\nGoverns interactions between parties to ensure privacy and security.\nThe IEEE considers HSML and HSTP a “Public Imperative”, a designation typically reserved for critical public infrastructure like nuclear energy, smart grids, and voting machines.\nA unified operating system, developed by VERSES, was built upon HSML and HSTP. It allows for the deployment of artificial intelligence applications in a way that addresses the contextual, spatial, and operational challenges.\nTHE CONTEXT CHALLENGE > CONTEXT AUGMENTS DATA FOR AIs\nThe world is overflowing with data, yet AI seems to be hitting a glass ceiling in terms of performance, relevance and explainability. This issue can be summarized as a challenge in context-making. Data is currently out of context, and it needs to be put into context. “Context” in this instance is the semantic, societal, situational, and environmental meta-data model about the activities of people, places and things over time. Context needs to be shared between networks of heterogeneous devices and applications empowering them to proactively offer enriched, situation-aware and usable content, instructions and experiences.\nContext is made up of the elements of relationships that define the entities, objects, locations and actions—commonly known as the Who, What, When, Where, How and Why of any scenario, contract or circumstance. The Spatial Web Foundation defined a context graph (HSML—see also below) that describes the relationships between these different context elements. In turn, the context-aware computing developed by VERSES (COSM operating system) enables increasing degrees of insight from the contextualized data. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SPATIAL CHALLENGE > SPATIAL DOMAINS AUGMENT DIGITAL TWINS\n\n3.1. Spatial Domains\nSpatial Domains are digital titles linked to 3D volumetric locations such as buildings, ports, streets, or larger regions, such as cities, states, continents and trading blocs. Spatial subdomains represent subspaces that have a holonic structure, which allows for the orchestration of hierarchical rights and policies.\nSpatial domains enable secure management of digitally mediated rights and permissions for:\nWho/what is authorized to access the domain.\nWhat content or data is available to view.\nWho can publish and modify content.\nWho can transact or interact with it.\n\nOne key piece of information maintained by the spatial domain is the 3D model itself.  This 3D model contains all the geometries, addresses, appropriate routes, location of IoT devices, and any subdomains.  The 3D model is dynamic and can be updated in real-time as local conditions change.\nSpatial Domains contain all the rules, rights, permissions, fees, 3D models, IoT devices, network access, etc. associated with a geospatial region as defined by their owner or authority. This results in a governance layer of geospatial information written in HSML that can be queried by agents as they approach and move through them. They also can be queried remotely, allowing AIs to assist in deciding the optimal route or best way to complete operations and transactions based on the domain's restrictions.\nSpatial domains use a holonic architecture, i.e., nested spatial domains, or holons, that inherit the rules above them and pass their rules to the ones below them.  For example, federal laws are usually applicable to states or provinces, however the local authorities will apply their own local ordinances as well. \n3.2. Spatial or Multidimensional Range Queries \nIn order for autonomous drones and vehicles to operate, and for AI to orchestrate their activities, a query method is required to gather all the data necessary from disparate sources; we call this system the Spatial DNS (sDNS).  \nSpatial DNS (nDimensional Range Query) & HSTP \nThe sDNS allows actors to request information via HSTP (Hyperspatial Transaction Protocol), such as:\nWhere can I go?\nHow should I go there?\nWhat can I do?\nWhat credentials do I need?\nWhat are the weather conditions there?\nWhat are the costs?\nH3 Geospatial Index\nTo query spatial domains, the actor or agent defines the geospatial area of interest using a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) called H3.  H3 allows for any geospatial shape to be queried on earth, resulting in an index of associated domains with very little latency.  These domains then can be queried further to discover their rules or data needed to carry out an operation. \n\nTHE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGE > COSM, AN AI-BASED CONTEXT COMPUTING PLATFORM\n4.1. Context Awareness\nVERSES’ flagship offering, COSM™ (Context-aware Open Service Mesh), is an Artificial Intelligence Operating System built upon the open protocols HSML and HSTP for managing resources and deploying AI applications on the Spatial Web. Its five Flow Modules are designed to address the requirements for a universal network of humans, machines, and AI. COSM™ contextualizes spatial relationships according to Spatial Domains through a Spatial Domain Name Service (SDNS) that organizes and allows for the management of policies and permissions.\nCOSM™ addresses the above requirements:\nIO-Flow (Communication): Interface agent. Management of connected devices to publish sensor data and instruct machines and humans to perform tasks.\nData-Flow (Interoperability): Context mapping. Normalization and correlation of data from disparate systems into a unified coherent HSML Context Graph™.\nDomain-Flow (Trust): Rule configuration. Definition of the policies, permissions, and credentials that govern the interactions of all actors on the Spatial Web.\nSim-Flow (Adaptability): Goal simulation. Simulation of goal-based optimizations based on requirements or restrictions, and recommendation of tasks to achieve ideal states.\nWork-Flow (Execution): Task engine. Delegation of optimization tasks to a connected workforce of humans, autonomous vehicles, and/or bots.  \nAll data coming from and to the IoT sensors will be converted into HSML the lingua franca of the digital twin, normalizing all its information. HSML is the language of the actor and its twin; it describes all operations and activities within either a COSM operating system or other OS utilizing HSML.\nUsing COSM offers the following capabilities:\nNew data meta-models and communication protocols that define a common method to describe, express, share, and update context between all the edges of a network. Context in this instance is the semantic, societal, situational, and environmental meta-data model about people, places, and things over time.\nContext is shared between networks of heterogeneous devices and applications, empowering them to proactively offer enriched, situation-aware, and usable content, instructions and experiences—like a situational communal garden of context information if you will.\nCOSM allows context to:\nBe stateful.\nBe machine-readable and executable.\nBe shareable between heterogeneous networks, devices and applications.\nMaintain coherence over time and space for all the actors/edges involved in a use case.\nThese new meta-models support context-aware applications that, in turn, are able to support interoperable, cross-platform networking between disparate hardware (e.g., autonomous drones, sensors, smart devices, robots) and software systems (e.g., enterprise services, cloud platforms, mobile applications, artificial intelligence) across different vendors and suppliers.\nThe challenges in modeling context are linked to—and not limited to—a set of constraints: they need to represent the relationship between the identity of the actor, the scope and authorization of his permissioned activities, and the place and time where they may happen. COSM coherently describes and maintains the where and when of any scenario (dimensions, space, time and channel), the why and how (i.e., conditions or governance—right, credential, claim and activity), and the who and what—i.e., objects—authority, domain, actor and asset).\nCOSM allows to orchestrate AIs that run on the same coherent context model, therefore compounding/allowing AIs to compete on the same data formats, in order to derive more relevant, more accurate, and more explainable simulations and recommendations.\nCOSM’s distributed holonic architecture enables AIs designed for specific optimized functions. It does so by ingesting and sharing data with other micro- & macro-COSMs above and below it, therefore providing the specific curated and normalized data required to efficiently perform their function. This type of holonic structure mirrors the neural network of the brain.   \nVERSES’ TIPS (Trust, Interoperability, Privacy, and Security) framework allows for the secure and privacy-preserving governance of people, places and things. This is not possible without having a network that is context-aware.\n\n4.2. Autonomous interoperability and internetworking edges\nAll autonomous actors on the network need to be aware of the other actors, their route, tasks, credentials, capabilities, sensors, etc.  This will enable actors to coordinate activities, work as swarms, alert each other to danger, and even share their sensor data with others on the network.  \nIn order to reach L5 autonomous driving, an interoperability system such as this needs to exist.  Without this capability all these actors will operate as independent nodes, working on their own without awareness or coordination of the others, which is the current state of autonomous vehicles.  \nVehicle capabilities\nA profile of the vehicle or drone and all its capabilities and limitations needs to be known in order for the system to assign the most optimal and safe route and coordinate its activities with other actors.  For example, how fast can a drone safely operate, under what weather conditions and carrying how much weight?\n\nVehicle digital twin\nEach vehicle is represented as a digital twin, cataloging and registering its many sensors into a single model.  This will allow the vehicle to act as a single organism, fusing all its sensors together.  The digital twin will allow for its authority to access and control all aspects of its sensors.  When a new IoT sensor is introduced to the vehicle, say a phone or a new camera, the vehicle’s actor detects its presence VIA bluetooth, and inspects its smart wallet to determine its credentials, capabilities, network and power requirements.  If the authority grants it access, it registers it into the digital twin and adds it to the sensor fusion model.  \n\nTHE POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE CHALLENGE > HOW TO MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE POLICIES THAT CAN BE INTERPRETED AND SHARED BY MACHINES AND HUMANS\n5.1. From analog policies to digital law\nExisting regulation has been drafted traditionally by humans and for humans, but with little regard for interpretability and  executability by a machine. There is tremendous value in seeking to bridge the gap between the traditional way of drafting and publishing regulation (i.e., by humans for humans) and having machine-readable and machine-executable regulation (i.e., by humans, for machines) especially in the context of autonomous mobility scenarios.\nTranslating existing regulation into machine-interpretable  and machine-executable code will allow us to properly capture how humans read and interpret the regulation,  and, when technology fails to do so, to develop an alternative that is technically feasible and can be acceptable for human  regulators. More generally, the challenge is to discover where and why technology can replace humans when it comes to interpretation, and where and why not.\nFurthermore, harmonized liability rules (for drones for example) are lacking at the EU level. Consequently, liability law is governed by the  traditional rules at the national (Member State) level. An innovation, therefore, lies in (1) the development of liability rules that are  (2) machine-interpretable and machine-executable. Finally, regulation is subject to change, and it is often multi-layered, meaning  that regulatory bodies at different levels (e.g., EU level, state level, municipality level, company level) jointly contribute to a specific  type of regulation. As a result, different pieces of regulation may consist of different languages. To make a regulation machine interpretable and machine-executable, and to make any interpretation model scalable, a semantic representation needs to be  available that accommodates regulatory changes and regulation at different levels and in different languages. The technological  challenge lies in developing a suitable semantic representation.\nVERSES developed automated tools with COSM and HSML for governing actions within the domain of Urban Air Mobility to enforce rules and policies systematically. Our solution allows current laws to be parsed into machine-readable models and interpreted programmatically, reducing the human interpretation of laws and guidelines into more binary statements. Our developed technology takes the legal text and constructs ontologies and context from automated Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methodologies. These are then used to construct machine-readable representations of specific legal scenarios. This information is then parsed into HSML, where it is combined with other sources of information (such as IoT devices, user input, cameras, drones, etc.).\nSeveral laws that have been converted into HSML have been tested in real-world flight environments, including rules about dynamically changing variables. We translated existing EU laws for Urban Air Mobility into HSML, ensuring that the proposed actions and flight plans automatically conform to the set of parsed rules and regulations at play:\nWe ensured that HSML could accommodate the vast array of prohibitive and deontic laws found in the EU literature.\nWe worked with legal experts to ensure that the assumptions made during the translation process abide by existing interpretations of the relevant laws.\nWe worked to provide a mechanism for suggesting legal innovations when a machine-readable format cannot straightforwardly accommodate the ambiguity of laws.\n5.2. Promises and challenges\nHSML allows the evaluation of  counterfactual actions - what would happen if someone were to perform a certain activity? We can use this to perform (abstract) routing - find (optimal) series of legal activities that get from HSML graph A to HSML graph B\nHSML is updated from a range of real-time data sources; it allows autonomous agents to dynamically operate within the confines of the law. If there is a law about maximum wind speed, and dynamically update the route given changing wind-speed conditions\nHSML can be extended beyond laws - any “rules of the games” can be constructed and abided by using the same schemas and systems\nThe law is inherently ambiguous and generally applied to humans (“UA operators must fly safely” - how do you define “safely”? Can AI operate safer than humans?). HSML can help automatically identify ambiguous laws and can provide a feedback mechanism for developing future analog laws with machine readability in mind. This can be the foundation for a virtuous two-way loop between analog law and digital law.\n\nA multi-sensor, AI-observed and operated transportation system would be able to analyze and measure the effectiveness and downsides of current legislation and infrastructure.  By modeling the existing laws and infrastructure, AI can run virtually infinite simulations, determining the optimal balance of efficiency and risk and thereby providing recommendations to legislators how best to adjust the laws and infrastructure in the real world.\nFLYING FORWARD 2020\n\nFlying Forward 2020: supporting the future of UAM with COSM’s geospatial governance capabilities and sensor fusion\nFlying Forward is a 3-year collaborative research project to develop a new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) ecosystem by incorporating UAM within a geospatial data infrastructure of cities. COSM is at the heart of that new infrastructure. COSM uses sensor fusion to provide the capabilities to govern the behavior of autonomous drones flying in urban areas. That involves integrating legal and spatial policies in the simulation and activation of the scenarios, while for example allowing for dynamic (re)routing, multi-party interoperability and managing landing zones.\nThe FF2020 demonstrators cover 5 use cases :\nSecurity and surveillance\nInfrastructure inspection\nAsset deliveries\nCrowd management\nEmergency deliveries.\n\nIn these scenarios, VERSES goes beyond Device Identification and Profile Authentication to make devices become Policy-aware and Location-aware. As a result, physical activities of IoT devices can be governed and enforceable at the hardware level.\nCOSM can, for example, create and manage flight corridors and no-fly zones across the city and around buildings, delivering everything from humans, packaging and surveillance. Other capabilities include Geofencing, waypoints planning, dynamic routing, object/people detection, video streaming, missions management, portal and app solution, human control, and much more.\nCOSM allows interoperability between all the edges and systems involved in the use cases and in particular allows the behavior of an,y “thing” (drone, car, truck, vessel…) to be law-abiding and adaptive in real-time to policy changes and updates\n\n\nMOBILITY USE CASES\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of examples VERSES and the Spatial Web are exploring with industry leaders and regulators.\n\nCommon shared understanding of the world\nWe believe that regulators and transportation authorities should assist in the creation of a global transportation digital twin, comprising all the local laws and rules digitally represented, machine-readable and queryable using spatial DNS (sDNS).\nCurrently, every car company must research, build and maintain their own model of the world’s laws and rules.  This is a huge expense and liability to the company and greatly hinders advancement as well as serving as a significant barrier to entry for startups.  Furthermore, since each company has their own siloed view of the world, true interoperability and shared understanding will never be possible and therefore L5 autonomy will be even more difficult to achieve.  \nSuch as system would enable independent simulators to have an accurate model of the world’s laws greatly increasing their efficacy.\nStreet sign database\nCurrently, vehicles can have a hard time recognizing the countless variations of international street signs.   A public and queryable database of all street signs and their meaning is needed to ensure safety. Furthermore, the spatial location of each sign and its jurisdiction needs to be registered so that ideally vehicles are aware of the rules of the road without the need to read the sign in the first place.\nCongestion, Routing, sequencing and optimization \nBy all actors anonymously sharing their routes and destinations, local and regional AI systems will be able to orchestrate their travel.  We envision this to be managed in a holonic method, organizing actors into groups of regional, city and local swarms.   First, the system would group an actor with other local actors into tight swarms of vehicles going in the same direction, splitting them off to join other swarms when needed to reach their destination.  Agents going cross town will be coordinated into trains of vehicles with gaps appropriately spaced to allow for other swarms to cross through them at intersections without having to come to a stop.  Swarms covering regional distances will be grouped into even larger swarms, acting like a bike peloton, reducing air friction and energy costs.  Vehicles can be moved through the swarm to mitigate their energy output, ensuring every vehicle can maximize its chance of reaching its destination without having to stop for recharging.  \nIntersections and air flight corridors\nAs vehicles approach highly congested road intersections or flight corridors, an AI for these spaces will be alerted of their presence and intention.  This hyper-localized AI will be responsible for the coordination and optimization of all vehicles in its domain as they traverse the space, effectively taking operational control until the vehicle is safely through the space whereby it will release control back to the agent and system to continue on its journey. \n\nEvery intersection and flight corridor is unique and has its own set of challenges and risks.  By modeling and analyzing the infrastructure, traffic flows and safety, the AI will be able to determine the optimal operational efficiency of each spatial domain and orchestrate all vehicles moving through it.  This is Urban Air planning and the foundation for augmenting Air Traffic Management solutions. \nCharging, energy and carbon reporting \nElectrical charging stations should report the associated carbon cost and help mitigate the cost with carbon offsets.  Energy used should be attributed to each actor and their route so the climate domain can get an accurate climate accounting of all transportation costs.   \nParking, landing zones and charging stations\nCars and drones looking for a place to park, land and re-charge will be able to query the network and find available space and services.  Depending on the settings of its authority it will decide the best place based on price, location and urgency.   All fees and transactions will be automatically managed by all the actor’s smart wallets, including the vehicle and space.  For example, the parking garage or charging station will have a smart wallet to facilitate all transactions.  See Smart Wallet below.  \nTransactions, fees, tolls, parking, charging\nTolls, fees, parking, charging costs, all these transactions should be seamless and frictionless, happening in the background and managed by a smart wallet.  Agents should be able to set their preferences, choosing to pay more for premium services or less if on a budget.  \nWeather and pollution\nIoT sensors already blanket urban spaces capturing atmospheric data.  Actors need to be able to access this data to be able to make decisions on hazards or weather conditions. \nConstruction\nMunicipalities publishing their construction schedules and IoT-enabled work crews will be able to update the network of all closed or reduced capacity areas, optimizing the rerouting or coordination of traffic as it moves through congested zones.  \nObstacle avoidance\nAutonomous vehicles will constantly be requesting the latest model of the local environment for the most up-to-date digital twin.  If it detects any new unexpected obstacles, like deer in the road, it will update the local digital twin of the environment and and alert all oncoming traffic of the new ephemeral risk.   When the deer finally moves on and is out of view, the passing cars will automatically update the local digital twin to its prior state.  \nBikes & scooters\nIn the future other modes of transportation like bikes, scooters and the like could be included in the network if their navigation system or the passenger’s smart app was registered as an actor in the system.   \nVehicles not on the system\nFor legacy cars not registered in the network, driving apps like Wayz or Google Maps could be utilized to register the car and its route, informing the driver of the optimal route and speed at which they should drive to keep pace with the swarm, timing all the lights and intersections and be altered to dangers.  The vehicle’s IoT sensors or cameras can still be registered and accessed by the system.   Other autonomous cars on the system would be aware of the unregistered car and its route, providing a little extra buffer to make allowances for the human operator.  \nCars completely off the network and not utilizing a driving app would be out on their own, but provided the driver was savvy they ought to be able to follow along with the swarm and stay in cadence.  Autonomous vehicles would be able to identify the car as out of network and make allowances to maintain safe travel.  \nMaaS \nWorking across local, regional, national and international levels, a MaaS network can see the entire transportation graph, query it, determine the optimal route, sequence and transportation mode, make reservations and facilitate it into a single transaction.  Cameras located on and inside the vehicle will be able to identify customers and passengers while protecting their identity us the TIPS (Trust, Interoperability, Privacy & Security) framework.  \nFirst responders and safety\nPolice and fire departments responding to emergencies will automatically be provided the right of way with the system prioritizing their route and pausing all other swarms and vehicles.  Swarms and vehicles will be routed around traffic stops, accidents, fires etc to ensure the flow of traffic ensues.  \nWhen accidents or fires are reported, the emergency response domain should be able anonymously to access any cameras or sensors in the vicinity to remotely get real-time information about the conditions and respond accordingly. \nWhen emergency calls for fires or accidents occur, a drone should be automatically dispatched to the scene, providing key live insights to first responders about the current situation, how to approach and whether it should they send for backup.  \nLighting\nAll lights on the network would be made aware of vehicles, bots and swarms, ensuring to keep their way properly lit at night and turned off to conserve energy when they are not.  Unregistered vehicles, bicycles, people etc can still activate the lights by means of motion detectors, computer vision and mobile apps.  \nEntertainment and marketing\nWhether riding with a friend or using a ride-sharing service, the system should anonymously recognize each individual and be able to seamlessly access their entertainment preferences, giving them direct access to their media accounts and applications.  \nRide-sharing services can provide discounted services in exchange for targeted marketing opportunities to their captive audiences.  \nInsurance\nWhen actors declare and register their route, it can be published to a real-time insurance market where insurance providers will be able to bid their services.  By utilizing anonymous certificates, actors will be able to share their risk profile and operating history without compromising their identity. Using a real-time insurance marketplace, actors will be able to select their preferred coverage based on price, local laws and service.   AI agents representing the vehicle's authority and the insurer will be able automatically to complete the transaction and ensure coverage. \n\nsDNS Public Utility\nWe consider the need for such a queryable spatial DNS (sDNS) to be a requirement for L5 autonomy.   The sDNS is a public imperative and should be run like a public utility, allowing for any certified actor to access the system, request the data needed to safely achieve their desired goals and anonymously report back to the system.  It should be overseen by an intenational standards body (such as the Spatial Web Foundation & IEEE) comprised of industry and government organizations with input from citizens and watchdogs.  It should strive for interoperablity so that all vehicles, anywhere in the world can safely and securely operate on it’s network.  As this network of vehicles, IoT devices, cameras and operators expands, it becomes a sprawling sensor fusion and data mesh, enabling actors, authorities and AI to access information privately and securely to more efficiently and safely manage operations across even greater heterogeneous data sources and industry domains. \nSUMMARY\n\nCOSM allows for systems to share a more complete and coherent understanding of activities and continuously self-optimize, there are several fundamental requirements that build upon each other:\nCommunication: a common query language in which to interface\nInteroperability: a common data model in which to map context\nTrust: verifiable data lineage, credentials, and governance\nAdaptability: flexible logic to simulate and adjust\nExecution: ability to orchestrate tasks and resources\nThe convergence of emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has created a need for a unified operational framework and system to contextualize, synchronize, and make interoperable the disparate data sources related to people, places, assets, and vehicles.

Prefix-Tuning: Optimizing Continuous Prompts for Generation\nXiang Lisa Li\nStanford University\nxlisali@stanford.edu\nPercy Liang\nStanford University\npliang@cs.stanford.edu\nAbstract\nFine-tuning is the de facto way to leverage\nlarge pretrained language models to perform\ndownstream tasks. However, it modifies all\nthe language model parameters and therefore\nnecessitates storing a full copy for each task.\nIn this paper, we propose prefix-tuning, a\nlightweight alternative to fine-tuning for natural language generation tasks, which keeps\nlanguage model parameters frozen, but optimizes a small continuous task-specific vector\n(called the prefix). Prefix-tuning draws inspiration from prompting, allowing subsequent tokens to attend to this prefix as if it were “virtual tokens”. We apply prefix-tuning to GPT-2\nfor table-to-text generation and to BART for\nsummarization. We find that by learning only\n0.1% of the parameters, prefix-tuning obtains\ncomparable performance in the full data setting, outperforms fine-tuning in low-data settings, and extrapolates better to examples with\ntopics unseen during training.\n1 Introduction\nFine-tuning is the prevalent paradigm for using\nlarge pretrained language models (LMs) (Radford\net al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019) to perform downstream tasks (e.g., summarization), but it requires\nupdating and storing all the parameters of the LM.\nConsequently, to build and deploy NLP systems\nthat rely on large pretrained LMs, one currently\nneeds to store a modified copy of the LM parameters for each task. This can be prohibitively expensive, given the large size of current LMs; for example, GPT-2 has 774M parameters (Radford et al.,\n2019) and GPT-3 has 175B parameters (Brown\net al., 2020).\nA natural approach to this problem is lightweight\nfine-tuning, which freezes most of the pretrained\nparameters and augments the model with small\ntrainable modules. For example, adapter-tuning\nFigure 1: Fine-tuning (top) updates all Transformer\nparameters (the red Transformer box) and requires storing a full model copy for each task. We propose\nprefix-tuning (bottom), which freezes the Transformer\nparameters and only optimizes the prefix (the red prefix blocks). Consequently, we only need to store the\nprefix for each task, making prefix-tuning modular and\nspace-efficient. Note that each vertical block denote\ntransformer activations at one time step.\n(Rebuffi et al., 2017; Houlsby et al., 2019) inserts\nadditional task-specific layers between the layers\nof pretrained language models. Adapter-tuning\nhas promising performance on natural language\nunderstanding and generation benchmarks, attaining comparable performance with fine-tuning while\nadding only around 2-4% task-specific parameters\n(Houlsby et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020).\nOn the extreme end, GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)\ncan be deployed without any task-specific tuning.\nInstead, users prepend a natural language task instruction (e.g., TL;DR for summarization) and a\nfew examples to the task input; then generate the\noutput from the LM. This approach is known as\nin-context learning or prompting.\nIn this paper, we propose prefix-tuning, a\nlightweight alternative to fine-tuning for natural language generation (NLG) tasks, inspired by prompting. Consider the task of generating a textual dearXiv:2101.00190v1 [cs.CL] 1 Jan 2021\nscription of a data table, as shown in Figure 1,\nwhere the task input is a linearized table (e.g.,\n“name: Starbucks | type: coffee shop”) and the output is a textual description (e.g., “Starbucks serves\ncoffee.”). Prefix-tuning prepends a sequence of\ncontinuous task-specific vectors to the input, which\nwe call a prefix, depicted by red blocks in Figure 1\n(bottom). For subsequent tokens, the Transformer\ncan attend to the prefix as if it were a sequence of\n“virtual tokens”, but unlike prompting, the prefix\nconsists entirely of free parameters which do not\ncorrespond to real tokens. In contrast to fine-tuning\nin Figure 1 (top), which updates all Transformer\nparameters and thus requires storing a tuned copy\nof the model for each task, prefix-tuning only optimizes the prefix. Consequently, we only need\nto store one copy of the large Transformer and a\nlearned task-specific prefix, yielding a very small\noverhead for each additional task (e.g., 250K parameters for table-to-text).\nIn contrast to fine-tuning, prefix-tuning is modular: we train an upstream prefix which steers a\ndownstream LM, which remains unmodified. Thus,\na single LM can support many tasks at once. In\nthe context of personalization where the tasks correspond to different users (Shokri and Shmatikov,\n2015; McMahan et al., 2016), we could have a separate prefix for each user trained only on that user’s\ndata, thereby avoiding data cross-contamination.\nMoreover, the prefix-based architecture enables us\nto even process examples from multiple users/tasks\nin a single batch, something that is not possible\nwith other lightweight fine-tuning approaches.\nWe evaluate prefix-tuning on table-to-text generation using GPT-2 and abstractive summarization using BART. In terms of storage, prefix-tuning\nstores 1000x fewer parameters than fine-tuning. In\nterms of performance when trained on full datasets,\nprefix-tuning and fine-tuning are comparable for\ntable-to-text (§6.1), while prefix-tuning suffers a\nsmall degradation for summarization (§6.2). In lowdata settings, prefix-tuning on average outperforms\nfine-tuning on both tasks (§6.3). Prefix-tuning also\nextrapolates better to tables (for table-to-text) and\narticles (for summarization) with unseen topics\n(§6.4).\n2 Related Work\nFine-tuning for natural language generation.\nCurrent state-of-the-art systems for natural language generation are based on fine-tuning pretrained LMs. For table-to-text generation, Kale\n(2020) fine-tunes a sequence-to-sequence model\n(T5; Raffel et al., 2020). For extractive and abstractive summarization, researchers fine-tune masked\nlanguage models (e.g., BERT; Devlin et al., 2019)\nand encode-decoder models (e.g., BART; Lewis\net al., 2020) respectively (Zhong et al., 2020; Liu\nand Lapata, 2019; Raffel et al., 2020). For other\nconditional NLG tasks such as machine translation and dialogue generation, fine-tuning is also the\nprevalent paradigm (Zhang et al., 2020c; Stickland\net al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). In\nthis paper, we focus on table-to-text using GPT-2\nand summarization using BART, but prefix-tuning\ncan be applied to other generation tasks and pretrained models.\nLightweight fine-tuning. Lightweight finetuning freezes most of the pretrained parameters\nand modifies the pretrained model with small\ntrainable modules. The key challenge is to identify\nhigh-performing architectures of the modules and\nthe subset of pretrained parameters to tune. One\nline of research considers removing parameters:\nsome model weights are ablated away by training\na binary mask over model parameters (Zhao et al.,\n2020; Radiya-Dixit and Wang, 2020). Another\nline of research considers inserting parameters.\nFor example, Zhang et al. (2020a) trains a “side”\nnetwork that is fused with the pretrained model via\nsummation; adapter-tuning inserts task-specific layers (adapters) between each layer of the pretrained\nLM (Houlsby et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020; Rebuffi\net al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2020). Compared to\nthis line of work, which tunes around 3.6% of the\nLM parameters, our method obtains a further 30x\nreduction in task-specific parameters, tuning only\n0.1% while maintaining comparable performance.\nPrompting. Prompting means prepending instructions and a few examples to the task input and\ngenerating the output from the LM. GPT-3 (Brown\net al., 2020) uses manually designed prompts to\nadapt its generation for different tasks, and this\nframework is termed in-context learning. However,\nsince Transformers can only condition on a\nbounded-length context (e.g., 2048 tokens for GPT3), in-context learning is unable to fully exploit\ntraining sets longer than the context window. Sun\nand Lai (2020) also prompt by keywords to control\nfor sentiment or topic of the generated sentence.\nIn natural language understanding tasks, prompt\nengineering has been explored in prior works for\nmodels like BERT and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019;\nJiang et al., 2020; Schick and Schutze ¨ , 2020). For\nexample, AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020) searches\nfor a sequence of discrete trigger words and concatenates it with each input to elicit sentiment or\nfactual knowledge from a masked LM. In contrast\nwith AutoPrompt, our method optimizes continuous prefixes, which are more expressive (§7.2);\nmoreover, we focus on language generation tasks.\nContinuous vectors have been used to steer language models; for example, Subramani et al. (2020)\nshowed that a pretrained LSTM language model\ncan reconstruct arbitrary sentences by optimizing\na continuous vector for each sentence, making the\nvector input-specific. In contrast, prefix-tuning optimizes a task-specific prefix that applies to all instances of that task. As a result, unlike the previous\nwork whose application is limited to sentence reconstruction, prefix-tuning can be applied to NLG\ntasks.\nControllable generation. Controllable generation aims to steer a pretrained language model to\nmatch a sentence level attribute (e.g., positive sentiment or topic on sports). Such control can happen\nat training time: Keskar et al. (2019) pretrains the\nlanguage model (CTRL) to condition on metadata\nsuch as keywords or URLs. Additionally, the control can happen at decoding time, by weighted decoding (GeDi, Krause et al., 2020) or iteratively updating the past activations (PPLM, Dathathri et al.,\n2020). However, there is no straightforward way\nto apply these controllable generation techniques\nto enforce fine-grained control over generated contents, as demanded by tasks like table-to-text and\nsummarization.\n3 Problem Statement\nConsider a conditional generation task where the\ninput is a context x and the output y is a sequence\nof tokens. We focus on two tasks, shown in Figure 2 (right): In table-to-text, x corresponds to a\nlinearized data table and y is a textual description;\nin summarization, x is an article and y is a short\nsummary.\n3.1 Autoregressive LM\nAssume we have an autoregressive language model\npφ(y | x) based on the Transformer (Vaswani et al.,\n2017) architecture (e.g., GPT-2; Radford et al.,\n2019) and parametrized by φ. As shown in Figure 2 (top), let z = [x; y] be the concatenation of x\nand y; let Xidx denote the sequence of indices that\ncorresponds to x, and Yidx denote the same for y.\nThe activation at time step i is hi ∈ R\nd\n, where\nhi = [h\n(1)\ni\n; · · · ; h\n(n)\ni\n] is a concatenation of all activation layers at this time step, and h\n(j)\ni\nis the activation of the j-th Transformer layer at time step i.\n1\nThe autoregressive Transformer model computes\nhi as a function of zi and the past activations in its\nleft context, as follows:\nhi = LMφ(zi\n, h<i), (1)\nwhere the last layer of hi\nis used to compute the\ndistribution for the next token: pφ(zi+1 | h≤i) =\nsoftmax(Wφ h\n(n)\ni\n) and Wφ is a pretrained matrix\nthat map h\n(n)\ni\nto logits over the vocabulary.\n3.2 Encoder-Decoder Architecture\nWe can also use an encoder-decoder architecture\n(e.g., BART; Lewis et al., 2020) to model pφ(y | x),\nwhere x is encoded by the bidirectional encoder,\nand the decoder predicts y autoregressively (conditioned on the encoded x and its left context). We\nuse the same indexing and activation notation, as\nshown in Figure 2 (bottom). hi for all i ∈ Xidx\nis computed by the bidirectional Transformer encoder; hi for all i ∈ Yidx is computed by the autoregressive decoder using the same equation (1).\n3.3 Method: Fine-tuning\nIn the fine-tuning framework, we initialize with the\npretrained parameters φ. Here pφ is a trainable language model distribution and we perform gradient\nupdates on the following log-likelihood objective:\nmax\nφ\nlog pφ(y | x) = X\ni∈Yidx\nlog pφ(zi\n| h<i). (2)\n4 Prefix-Tuning\nWe propose prefix-tuning as an alternative to\nfine-tuning for conditional generation tasks. We\nfirst provide intuition in §4.1 before defining our\nmethod formally in §4.2.\n1h\n(n)\ni\nis composed of a key-value pair. In GPT-2, the\ndimension of each key and value is 1024.\nFigure 2: An annotated example of prefix-tuning using an autoregressive LM (top) and an encoder-decoder model\n(bottom). The prefix activations ∀i ∈ Pidx, hi are drawn from a trainable matrix Pθ. The remaining activations are\ncomputed by the Transformer.\n4.1 Intuition\nBased on intuition from prompting, we believe that\nhaving a proper context can steer the LM without\nchanging its parameters. For example, if we want\nthe LM to generate a word (e.g., Obama), we can\nprepend its common collocations as context (e.g.,\nBarack), and the LM will assign much higher probability to the desired word. Extending this intuition\nbeyond generating a single word or sentence, we\nwant to find a context that steers the LM to solve\nan NLG task. Intuitively, the context can influence the encoding of x by guiding what to extract\nfrom x; and can influence the generation of y by\nsteering the next token distribution. However, it’s\nnon-obvious whether such a context exists. Natural\nlanguage task instructions (e.g., “summarize the\nfollowing table in one sentence”) might guide an\nexpert annotator to solve the task, but fail for most\npretrained LMs.2 Data-driven optimization over\nthe discrete instructions might help, but discrete\noptimization is computationally challenging.\nInstead of optimizing over discrete tokens, we\ncan optimize the instruction as continuous word embeddings, whose effects will be propagated upward\nto all Transformer activation layers and rightward\nto subsequent tokens. This is strictly more expressive than a discrete prompt which requires matching the embedding of a real word. Meanwhile,\nthis is less expressive than intervening all layers of\nthe activations (§7.2), which avoids long-range dependencies and includes more tunable parameters.\nPrefix-tuning, therefore, optimizes all layers of the\nprefix.\n2\nIn our preliminary experiments, GPT-2 and BART fail in\nthis setting; the only exception is GPT-3.\n4.2 Method\nPrefix-tuning prepends a prefix for an autoregressive LM to obtain z = [PREFIX; x; y], or prepends\nprefixes for both encoder and encoder to obtain\nz = [PREFIX; x; PREFIX0\n; y], as shown in Figure 2.\nHere, Pidx denotes the sequence of prefix indices,\nand we use |Pidx| to denote the length of the prefix.\nWe follow the recurrence relation in equation (1), except that the prefix are free parameters. Prefix-tuning initializes a trainable matrix Pθ\n(parametrized by θ) of dimension |Pidx| × dim(hi)\nto store the prefix parameters.\nhi =\n(\nPθ[i, :], if i ∈ Pidx,\nLMφ(zi\n, h<i), otherwise.\n(3)\nThe training objective is the same as equation (2),\nbut the set of trainable parameters changes: the language model parameters φ are fixed and the prefix\nparameters θ are the only trainable parameters.\nHere, hi (for all i) is a function of the trainable\nPθ. When i ∈ Pidx, this is clear because hi copies\ndirectly from Pθ. When i 6∈ Pidx, hi still depends\non Pθ, because the prefix activations are always\nin the left context and will therefore affect any\nactivations to its right.\n4.3 Parametrization of Pθ\nEmpirically, directly updating the Pθ parameters\nleads to unstable optimization and a slight drop\nin performance.3 So we reparametrize the matrix\nPθ[i, :] = MLPθ(P\n0\nθ\n[i, :]) by a smaller matrix (P\n0\nθ\n)\ncomposed with a large feedforward neural network\n(MLPθ). Note that Pθ and P\n0\nθ\nhas the same rows\n3We find in preliminary experiments that directly optimizing the prefix is very sensitive to the learning rate and\ninitialization.\ndimension (i.e. the prefix length), but different\ncolumns dimension.4 Once training is complete,\nthese reparametrization parameters can be dropped,\nand only the prefix (Pθ) needs to be saved.\n5 Experimental Setup\n5.1 Datasets and Metrics\nWe evaluate on three standard neural generation\ndatasets for the table-to-text task: E2E (Novikova\net al., 2017), WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017), and\nDART (Radev et al., 2020). The datasets are ordered by increasing complexity and size. E2E only\nhas 1 domain (i.e. restaurant reviews); WebNLG\nhas 14 domains, and DART is open-domain, using\nopen-domain tables from Wikipedia.\nThe E2E dataset contains approximately 50K\nexamples with 8 distinct fields; it contains multiple\ntest references for one source table, and the average\noutput length is 22.9. We use the official evaluation\nscript, which reports BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002),\nNIST (Belz and Reiter, 2006), METEOR (Lavie\nand Agarwal, 2007), ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), and\nCIDEr (Vedantam et al., 2015).\nThe WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) dataset consists of 22K examples, and the input x is a sequence\nof (subject, property, object) triples. The average\noutput length is 22.5. In the training and validation\nsplits, the input describes entities from 9 distinct\nDBpedia categories (e.g., Monument). The test\nsplit consists of two parts: the first half contains\nDB categories seen in training data, and the second half contains 5 unseen categories. These unseen categories are used to evaluate extrapolation.\nWe use the official evaluation script, which reports\nBLEU, METEOR and TER (Snover et al., 2006).\nDART (Radev et al., 2020) is an open domain\ntable-to-text dataset, with similar input format\n(entity-relation-entity triples) as WebNLG. The average output length is 21.6. It consists of 82K examples from WikiSQL, WikiTableQuestions, E2E,\nand WebNLG and applies some manual or automated conversion. We use the official evaluation\nscript and report BLEU, METEOR, TER, MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019), BERTScore (Zhang et al.,\n2020b) and BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020).\nFor the summarization task, we use the XSUM\n(Narayan et al., 2018) dataset, which is an abstrac4Pθ has a dimension of |Pidx| × dim(hi) while Pθ has\na dimension of |Pidx| × k, where we choose k = 512 for\ntable-to-text and 800 for summarization. MLPθ maps from\ndimension k to dim(hi)\ntive summarization dataset on news articles. There\nare 225K examples. The average length of the articles is 431 words and the average length of the\nsummaries is 23.3. We report ROUGE-1, ROUGE2 and ROUGE-L.\n5.2 Methods\nFor table-to-text generation, we compare prefixtuning with three other methods: fine-tuning (FINETUNE), fine-tuning only the top 2 layers (FT-TOP2),\nand adapter-tuning (ADAPTER).5 We also report\nthe current state-of-the-art results on these datasets:\nOn E2E, Shen et al. (2019) uses a pragmatically\ninformed model without pretraining. On WebNLG,\nKale (2020) fine-tunes T5-large. On DART, no\nofficial models trained on this dataset version are\nreleased.6 For summarization, we compare against\nfine-tuning BART (Lewis et al., 2020).\n5.3 Architectures and Hyperparameters\nFor table-to-text, we use GPT-2MEDIUM and GPT2LARGE; the source tables are linearized.7 For summarization, we use BARTLARGE,\n8\nand the source\narticles are truncated to 512 BPE tokens.\nOur implementation is based on the Hugging\nFace Transformer models (Wolf et al., 2020).\nAt training time, we use the AdamW optimizer\n(Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) and a linear learning rate scheduler, as suggested by the Hugging\nFace default setup. The hyperparameters we tune\ninclude the number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, and prefix length. Hyperparameter details\nare in the appendix. A default setting trains for 10\nepochs, using a batch size of 5, a learning rate of\n5 · 10−5\nand a prefix length of 10. The table-to-text\nmodels are trained on TITAN Xp or GeForce GTX\nTITAN X machines. Prefix-tuning takes 0.2 hours\nper epochs to train on 22K examples , whereas finetuning takes around 0.3 hours. The summarization\nmodels are trained on Tesla V100 machines, taking\n1.25h per epoch on the XSUM dataset.\nAt decoding time, for the three table-to-text\ndatasets, we use beam search with a beam size\nof 5. For summarization, we use a beam size of 6\n5\nSame implementation as Lin et al. (2020).\n6The official benchmark model is trained on v.1.0.0 while\nthe release dataset is v1.1.1.\n7\nIn comparison with natural language utterances, the linearized table is in an unnatural format, which might be challenging for pretrained LMs.\n8We didn’t include GPT-2 results for summarization because in our preliminary experiment, fine-tuning GPT-2 significantly underperforms fine-tuning BART on XSUM.\nand length normalization of 0.8. Decoding takes\n1.2 seconds per sentence (without batching) for\ntable-to-text, and 2.6 seconds per batch (using a\nbatch size of 10) for summarization.\n6 Main Results\n6.1 Table-to-text Generation\nWe find that adding only 0.1% task-specific parameters,9 prefix-tuning is effective in table-to-text generation, outperforming other lightweight baselines\n(ADAPTER and FT-TOP2) and achieving a comparable performance with fine-tuning. This trend is\ntrue across all three datasets: E2E, WebNLG,10 and\nDART.\nFor a fair comparison, we match the number of\nparameters for prefix-tuning and adapter-tuning to\nbe 0.1%. Table 1 shows that prefix-tuning is significantly better than ADAPTER (0.1%), attaining\n4.1 BLEU improvement per dataset on average.\nEven when we compare with fine-tuning (100%)\nand adapter-tuning (3.0%), which update significantly more parameters than prefix-tuning, prefixtuning still achieves results comparable or better\nthan those two systems. This demonstrates that\nprefix-tuning is more Pareto efficient than adaptertuning, significantly reducing parameters while improving generation quality.\nAdditionally, attaining good performance on\nDART suggests that prefix-tuning can generalize\nto tables with diverse domains and a large pool\nof relations. We will delve deeper into extrapolation performance (i.e. generalization to unseen\ncategories or topics) in §6.4.\nOverall, prefix-tuning is an effective and spaceefficient method to adapt GPT-2 to table-to-text\ngeneration. The learned prefix is expressive enough\nto steer GPT-2 in order to correctly extract contents\nfrom an unnatural format and generate a textual\ndescription. Prefix-tuning also scales well from\nGPT-2MEDIUM to GPT-2LARGE, suggesting it has\nthe potential to scale to even larger models with a\nsimilar architecture, like GPT-3.\n6.2 Summarization\nAs shown in Table 2, with 2% parameters, prefixtuning obtains slightly lower performance than fine9\n250K for E2E, 250K for WebNLG, and 500K for DART\nvs. 345M GPT-2 parameters.\n10The S,U,A columns in WebNLG represents SEEN, UNSEEN, and ALL respectively; SEEN categories appear at\ntraining time; UNSEEN categories only appears at test time;\nand ALL is the combination of the two.\ntuning (36.05 vs. 37.25 in ROUGE-L). With only\n0.1% parameters, prefix-tuning underperforms full\nfine-tuning (35.05 vs. 37.25). There are several\ndifferences between XSUM and the three table-totext datasets which could account for why prefixtuning has comparative advantage in table-to-text:\n(1) XSUM contains 4x more examples than the\nthree table-to-text datasets on average; (2) the input articles are 17x longer than the linearized table\ninput of table-to-text datasets on average; (3) summarization might be more complex than table-totext because it requires reading comprehension and\nidentifying key contents from an article.\n6.3 Low-data Setting\nBased on the results from table-to-text (§6.1)\nand summarization (§6.2), we observe that prefixtuning has a comparative advantage when the\nnumber of training examples is smaller. To construct low-data settings, we subsample the full\ndataset (E2E for table-to-text and XSUM for\nsummarization) to obtain small datasets of size\n{50, 100, 200, 500}. For each size, we sample 5\ndifferent datasets and average over 2 training random seeds. Thus, we average over 10 models to\nget an estimate for each low-data setting.11\nFigure 3 (right) shows that prefix-tuning outperforms fine-tuning in low-data regimes by 2.9 BLEU\non average, in addition to requiring many fewer parameters, but the gap narrows as the dataset size\nincreases.\nQualitatively, Figure 3 (left) shows 8 examples\ngenerated by both prefix-tuning and fine-tuning\nmodels trained on different data levels. While both\nmethods tend to undergenerate (missing table contents) in low data regimes, prefix-tuning tends to be\nmore faithful than fine-tuning. For example, finetuning (100, 200)12 falsely claims a low customer\nrating while the true rating is average, whereas\nprefix-tuning (100, 200) generates a description\nthat is faithful to the table.\n6.4 Extrapolation\nWe now investigate extrapolation performance to\nunseen topics for both table-to-text and summarization. In order to construct an extrapolation setting,\nwe split the existing datasets so that training and\ntest cover different topics. For table-to-text, the\n11We also sample a dev split (with dev size = 30% × training size ) for each training set. We use the dev split to choose\nhyperparameters and do early stopping.\n12The number in the parenthesis refers to the training size.\nE2E WebNLG DART\nBLEU NIST MET R-L CIDEr BLEU MET TER ↓ BLEU MET TER ↓ Mover BERT BLEURT\nS U A S U A S U A\nGPT-2MEDIUM\nFINE-TUNE 68.2 8.62 46.2 71.0 2.47 64.2 27.7 46.5 0.45 0.30 0.38 0.33 0.76 0.53 46.2 0.39 0.46 0.50 0.94 0.39\nFT-TOP2 68.1 8.59 46.0 70.8 2.41 53.6 18.9 36.0 0.38 0.23 0.31 0.49 0.99 0.72 41.0 0.34 0.56 0.43 0.93 0.21\nADAPTER(3%) 68.9 8.71 46.1 71.3 2.47 60.4 48.3 54.9 0.43 0.38 0.41 0.35 0.45 0.39 45.2 0.38 0.46 0.50 0.94 0.39\nADAPTER(0.1%) 66.3 8.41 45.0 69.8 2.40 54.5 45.1 50.2 0.39 0.36 0.38 0.40 0.46 0.43 42.4 0.36 0.48 0.47 0.94 0.33\nPREFIX(0.1%) 69.7 8.81 46.1 71.4 2.49 62.9 45.6 55.1 0.44 0.38 0.41 0.35 0.49 0.41 46.4 0.38 0.46 0.50 0.94 0.39\nGPT-2LARGE\nFINE-TUNE 68.5 8.78 46.0 69.9 2.45 65.3 43.1 55.5 0.46 0.38 0.42 0.33 0.53 0.42 47.0 0.39 0.46 0.51 0.94 0.40\nPrefix 70.3 8.85 46.2 71.7 2.47 63.4 47.7 56.3 0.45 0.39 0.42 0.34 0.48 0.40 46.7 0.39 0.45 0.51 0.94 0.40\nSOTA 68.6 8.70 45.3 70.8 2.37 63.9 52.8 57.1 0.46 0.41 0.44 - - - - - - - - -\nTable 1: Metrics (higher is better, except for TER) for table-to-text generation on E2E (left), WebNLG (middle)\nand DART (right).

So we evaluate extrapolation by training on the SEEN categories and\ntesting on the UNSEEN categories.

Performance increases as the prefix length increases up to a threshold\n(200 for summarization and 10 for table-to-text) and\nthen a slight performance drop occurs. Each plot reports two metrics (on two vertical axes).\nreason for such gains is an open question and we\nwill discuss further in §8.\n7 Intrinsic Evaluation\nWe compare different variants of prefix-tuning.\n§7.1 studies the impact of the prefix length. §7.2\nstudies tuning only the embedding layer, which is\nmore akin to tuning a discrete prompt. §7.3 compares prefixing and infixing, which inserts trainable\nactivations between x and y. §7.4 studies the impact of various prefix initialization strategies.\n7.1 Prefix Length\nA longer prefix means more trainable parameters,\nand therefore more expressive power. Figure 4\nshows that performance increases as the prefix\nlength increases up to a threshold (200 for summarization, 10 for table-to-text) and then a slight\nperformance drop occurs.14\nEmpirically, longer prefixes have a negligible\nimpact on inference speed, because attention computation over the entire prefix is parallellized on\nGPUs.\n7.2 Full vs Embedding-only\nRecall in §4.1, we discuss the option of optimizing\nthe continuous embeddings of the “virtual tokens.”\nWe instantiate that idea and call it embedding-only\nablation. The word embeddings are free parameters, and the upper activation layers are computed\nby the Transformer. Table 4 (top) shows that the\nperformance drops significantly, suggesting that\ntuning only the embedding layer is not sufficiently\nexpressive.\nThe embedding-only ablation upper bounds the\nperformance of discrete prompt optimization (Shin\n14Prefixes longer than the threshold lead to lower training\nloss, but slightly worse test performance, suggesting that they\ntend to overfit the training data.\nE2E\nBLEU NIST MET ROUGE CIDEr\nPREFIX 69.7 8.81 46.1 71.4 2.49\nEmbedding-only: EMB-{PrefixLength}\nEMB-1 48.1 3.33 32.1 60.2 1.10\nEMB-10 62.2 6.70 38.6 66.4 1.75\nEMB-20 61.9 7.11 39.3 65.6 1.85\nInfix-tuning: INFIX-{PrefixLength}\nINFIX-1 67.9 8.63 45.8 69.4 2.42\nINFIX-10 67.2 8.48 45.8 69.9 2.40\nINFIX-20 66.7 8.47 45.8 70.0 2.42\nTable 4: Intrinsic evaluation of Embedding-only (§7.2)\nand Infixing (§7.3).

Consequently, we have this chain\nof increasing expressive power: discrete prompting\n< embedding-only ablation < prefix-tuning.\n7.3 Prefixing vs Infixing\nWe also investigate how the trainable activations’\nposition in the sequence affects performance. In\nprefix-tuning, we place them at the beginning\n[PREFIX; x; y]. We can also place the trainable\nactivations between x and y (i.e. [x; INFIX; y]) and\ncall this infix-tuning. Table 4 (bottom) shows that\ninfix-tuning slightly underperforms prefix-tuning.\nWe believe this is because prefix-tuning can affect\nthe activations of x and y whereas infix-tuning can\nonly influence the activations of y.\n7.4 Initialization\nWe find that how the prefix is initialized has a large\nimpact in low-data settings. Random initialization\nleads to low performance with high variance.\nInitializing the prefix with activations of real words\nsignificantly improves generation, as shown in Figure 5. In particular, initializing with task relevant\nwords such as “summarization” and “table-to-text”\nobtains slightly better performance than task\nirrelevant words such as “elephant” and “divide”,\nbut using real words is still better than random.\nSince we initialize the prefix with activations\nof real words computed by the LM, this initialization strategy is concordant with preserving the\npretrained LM as much as possible.\n8 Discussion\nIn this section, we will discuss several favorable\nproperties of prefix-tuning and some open problems.\n8.1 Personalization\nAs we note in §1, prefix-tuning is advantageous\nwhen there are a large number of tasks that needs\nto be trained independently. One practical setting is\nuser privacy (Shokri and Shmatikov, 2015; McMahan et al., 2016). In order to preserve user privacy,\neach user’s data needs to be separated and a personalized model needs to be trained independently\nfor each user. Consequently, each user can be regarded as an independent task. If there are millions\nof users, prefix-tuning can scale to this setting and\nmaintain modularity, enabling flexible addition or\ndeletion of users by adding or deleting their prefixes without cross-contamination.\n8.2 Batching Across Users\nUnder the same personalization setting, prefixtuning allows batching different users’ queries even\nthough they are backed by different prefixes. When\nmultiple users query a cloud GPU device with their\ninputs, it is computationally efficient to put these\nusers in the same batch. Prefix-tuning keeps the\nshared LM intact; consequently, batching requires\na simple step of prepending the personalized prefix\nto user input, and all the remaining computation\nis unchanged. In contrast, we can’t batch across\ndifferent users in adapter-tuning, which has personalized adapters between shared Transformer layers.\n8.3 Inductive Bias of Prefix-tuning\nRecall that fine-tuning updates all pretrained parameters, whereas prefix-tuning and adapter-tuning\npreserve them. Since the language models are pretrained on general purpose corpus, preserving the\nLM parameters might help generalization to domains unseen during training. In concordance with\nthis intuition, we observe that both prefix-tuning\nand adapter-tuning have significant performance\ngain in extrapolation settings (§6.4); however, the\nreason for such gain is an open question.\nWhile prefix-tuning and adapter-tuning both\nfreeze the pretrained parameters, they tune different\nsets of parameters to affect the activation layers of\nthe Transformer. Recall that prefix-tuning keeps the\nLM intact and uses the prefix and the pretrained attention blocks to affect the subsequent activations;\nadapter-tuning inserts trainable modules between\nLM layers, which directly add residual vectors to\nthe activations. Moreover, we observe that prefixtuning requires vastly fewer parameters compared\nto adapter-tuning while maintaining comparable\nperformance. We think this gain in parameter efficiency is because prefix-tuning keeps the pretrained\nLM intact as much as possible, and therefore exploits the LM more than adapter-tuning.\nConcurrent work by Aghajanyan et al. (2020)\nuses intrinsic dimension to show that there exists\na low dimension reparameterization that is as effective for fine-tuning as the full parameter space.\nThis explains why good accuracy on downstream\ntask can be obtained by updating only a small number of parameters. Our work echoes the finding by\nshowing that good generation performance can be\nattained by updating a very small prefix.\n9 Conclusion\nWe have proposed prefix-tuning, a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning that prepends a trainable\ncontinuous prefix for NLG tasks. We discover that\ndespite learning 1000x fewer parameters than finetuning, prefix-tuning can maintain a comparable\nperformance in a full data setting and outperforms\nfine-tuning in both low-data and extrapolation settings.\nReferences\nArmen Aghajanyan, Luke Zettlemoyer, and Sonal\nGupta. 2020.

The specific problem statement for a given project will depend on the focus and goals of the research.\n\n\n\n\nSanket Nadagouda\nThis research paper's major focus is on how artificial intelligence (AI) is expanding in the leisure sector. With the help of AI-powered tools such as dynamic pricing SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), attraction operators like Amusement Park, Museum, Theatre & live venues, Festival & events, and Zoo can now maximize their occupancy rates and optimize their revenue. Dynamic pricing is already used by many industries like Travel, Hotel, and Taxi services. However, there isn't an integrated tool for the attractions sector, therefore AI-driven Unified Commerce fills this gap. By applying predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms, dynamic pricing and unified commerce, leisure businesses may utilise data to make smarter decisions about how to use them in their operations. SaaS makes it possible for businesses to use customised pricing techniques that can help them manage their inventory more effectively, strengthen customer happiness, and maximize their profits. \nAttraction industry operators now have the ability to react swiftly, precisely, and accurately to customer requirements thanks to the adoption of Unified Commerce. The way industry operators conduct business may be revolutionised by this new technology, which will also help them to stay competitive. AI has the potential to transform the leisure business and increase business operators' profitability with the correct deployment.\n\nYes, the research paper you describe focuses on the potential of AI and dynamic pricing SaaS in the leisure industry, and how these tools can be used to increase occupancy rates and optimize revenue. The paper discusses how AI-powered unified commerce can help attraction operators make better use of data and make more informed decisions about their operations. It also highlights the potential benefits of using AI-driven dynamic pricing, including increased customer satisfaction and improved profitability. Overall, the research suggests that AI has the potential to significantly improve the way leisure businesses operate and help them stay competitive in a rapidly changing market.\n\n\n\n\nSanket Nadagouda\nCan you write a business model based on this topic?\n\nSure, here is a potential business model based on the use of AI and dynamic pricing SaaS in the leisure industry:\n\nThe business offers AI-powered dynamic pricing software as a service (SaaS) to attraction operators in the leisure industry, such as amusement parks, museums, theaters, festivals, and zoos.\nThe software uses predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms to help these operators make more informed decisions about pricing and inventory management, based on data about customer behavior and market trends.\nThe business charges a subscription fee for access to the software, and offers training and support services to help operators get the most out of the tool.\nThe software helps operators increase their occupancy rates and optimize their revenue by enabling them to use customized pricing techniques that are tailored to their specific business needs.\nAs a result, operators are able to provide better customer experiences and increase their profitability, which helps them stay competitive in the highly dynamic leisure industry.\nThis is just one potential business model, and it could be adapted and refined based on the specific goals and needs of the business. It is important to carefully consider the target market, pricing strategy, and value proposition in order to develop a successful and sustainable business model.\n\n\n\n\nSanket Nadagouda\nHow about a business plan?\n\nA business plan is a detailed document that outlines the goals and strategies of a business, and describes how the business will operate and generate revenue.

The primary function of a firewall is to block unauthorized access to or from a private network while allowing authorized communication. Firewalls can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both. Some of the key functions of a firewall include:Packet filtering: Firewalls can filter traffic based on the source and destination IP address, port number, and other packet header information. This allows the firewall to block traffic from known malicious sources, such as IP addresses that are known to be associated with hackers or botnets.Stateful inspection: This function allows firewalls to examine the state of the connection and the packets being exchanged. It also uses protocol state information to determine whether the traffic is part of a legitimate connection or not, and whether the traffic conforms to the expected behavior of the application protocol.Network address translation (NAT): NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address. This can help to conceal the internal network structure and make it more difficult for hackers to gain access to the network.Virtual private network (VPN) support: Many firewalls support VPN protocols such as PPTP, L2TP and IPSec. This allows remote users to securely access the private network as if they were directly connected to it.Authentication: Some firewalls can authenticate users before allowing them to access the network. This can help to ensure that only authorized users have access to the network and its resources.Intrusion detection and prevention: Some firewalls can detect and prevent intrusion attempts by analyzing network traffic for known attack signatures or anomalies in the traffic flow.Overall, the primary function of a firewall is to control the access to and from the network, and these functions help to implement security policies and rules that could ensure the security and privacy of the network and devices.What is MIS?

However, these models may not be entirely appropriate for evaluating information systems (IS) for a number of reasons:Difficulty in quantifying benefits: Many of the benefits of an IS, such as increased efficiency, improved decision-making, and better customer service, can be difficult to quantify in financial terms.Difficulty in estimating costs: The costs of an IS, such as hardware, software, and personnel, can be difficult to estimate and may change over time.Long-term benefits: Many ISs provide benefits over a long period of time, which may not be captured by traditional financial models that focus on short-term results.Non-financial benefits: Many ISs provide benefits that cannot be easily quantified in financial terms, such as improved employee morale, increased customer satisfaction and increase in knowledge sharing.Intangibles: ISs can also introduce some intangibles benefits that can't be quantified in financial terms, such as the ability to make better and faster decisions, providing new ways to enter new markets, improving the customer relationship.Because of these limitations, organizations often use a combination of financial and non-financial evaluation methods to evaluate ISs. These methods may include cost-benefit analysis, break-even analysis, and systems development life cycle (SDLC) methodologies. These methods take into consideration a broader range of factors, such as the strategic benefits of the system, the alignment of the system with business goals, and the ability of the system to meet the needs of the users. Additionally, it's common that organizations also use balanced scorecard approach, this approach is to measure an IS's performance with a combination of financial, customer, internal processes and learning and growth perspectives.What do you mean by business processA business process refers to a set of activities or tasks that are performed to achieve a specific business goal or objective. Business processes can be found in any type of organization and can be simple or complex.Business processes are designed to achieve specific goals, such as:Reducing costsImproving efficiencyEnhancing customer serviceImproving qualityIncreasing revenuesComplying with regulationsExamples of common business processes include:Order fulfillmentAccounts payable and receivableHuman resources managementMarketing and salesInventory managementCustomer serviceSupply chain managementManufacturingA business process is made up of different steps or activities, it is possible to identify the inputs, outputs, and the actors that are involved.

EDI enables organizations to automate their business processes and improve their efficiency by reducing the need for manual data entry, reduce errors and delays, increase security and make data more accurate.Enterprise resource planning in 2 sentences Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a type of software that organizations use to manage and automate key business processes, such as financial management, human resources, supply chain management, manufacturing, and customer relationship management. ERP systems provide a centralized, integrated view of all the data and processes across an organization, allowing for more efficient and effective management of resources, improved decision-making, and greater operational visibility.Explain the business value of internet, intranet and extranetThe Internet, intranet, and extranet are all networks that can provide business value to organizations in different ways:The Internet: The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that allows users to share information and communicate with one another. The Internet provides businesses with access to a vast array of resources, including news, research, and a wide range of software tools that can be used to improve operations, marketing and communication. By having access to the internet, companies are able to reach a much wider audience and access to a global market place.Intranet: An intranet is a private network that is used within an organization, typically accessible only to employees. Intranets provide businesses with a secure and centralized platform for sharing information, such as company news and internal resources like policies, procedures, forms and training materials. Intranets also allow employees to communicate with each other, share files and collaborate on projects, which can lead to increased productivity and improved teamwork.Extranet: An extranet is a private network that is used by an organization to share information and resources with external partners or customers. Extranets provide businesses with a way to extend the functionality of their intranet to external parties, such as suppliers, partners or customers. Extranets enable business partners and other external stakeholders to access and share information, such as inventory levels, product information, and order status, thus increasing collaboration and speeding up the business process.Overall, the internet, intranet and extranet can provide businesses with a number of benefits including improved communication, increased productivity, and access to new markets, customers and partners. They also offer an opportunity to automate manual business processes and to increase the flow of accurate information, allowing business to make well-informed decisions.Enterprise resource planning Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is a type of software that organizations use to manage and automate key business processes across multiple functional areas, such as finance, human resources, supply chain management, manufacturing, and customer relationship management.

The implementation of an ERP system may require a significant investment in software, hardware, and professional services, but the benefits can include improved data accuracy, cost savings, and better use of resources, which can ultimately contribute to improving the company’s bottom line.Explain the business value of security and controlSecurity and control are critical to the success of any organization as they help protect against threats, maintain data integrity, and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The business value of security and control can be seen in several ways:Protecting assets: Security measures help to protect an organization's assets, such as data, networks, and physical facilities, from unauthorized access and threats such as hacking, malware, and physical theft. This helps to prevent data breaches, maintain the integrity of information, and safeguard against the loss of sensitive or proprietary information.Compliance: Many organizations are subject to laws and regulations that require them to maintain certain levels of security and control over their data and systems. Examples of these regulations include HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC2 and GDPR, non-compliance with these regulations can result in fines, legal action and reputational damage.Managing risk: Security and control measures help organizations to identify and mitigate risks to their operations, such as the risk of data breaches or operational failures. This enables organizations to make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and prioritize security initiatives.Improving efficiency: Security and control measures, such as access controls, can help to streamline operations by controlling who has access to sensitive information and resources and restrict access to only authorized users. This can help to reduce the risk of data breaches and increase the efficiency of operations.Building trust: Security and control measures help to instill trust in an organization's operations, products and services. Customers, suppliers, and partners are more likely to do business with an organization that they believe can protect their data and systems. This can help to build stronger relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners, which in turn can lead to increased revenue and growth.Supporting decision making: Having a good level of security and control in place provides data and insights for decision making, executives can make better decisions based on accurate, secure and complete information, rather than on assumptions or guesses.Overall, security and control are essential for protecting an organization's assets, complying with legal and regulatory requirements, managing risk, improving efficiency, building trust, and supporting decision making. By implementing robust security and control measures, organizations can gain a competitive edge, boost their reputation, and increase their bottom line.What is network economics ? ExplainNetwork economics is a branch of economics that studies the effects of networks and network effects on economic behavior and outcomes. A network effect is a phenomenon where a good or service becomes more valuable as more people use it, this makes the value of a network increase as it gets more users or nodes.Network economics is particularly relevant in the context of digital goods and services, such as social networks, communication platforms, and e-commerce websites, as these goods and services often exhibit strong network effects.One of the key insights of network economics is that the value of a network to a user increases with the number of other users on the network, this is known as a direct network effect, this applies for example in social networks, the more friends you have the more valuable the network is for you. And in communication networks the more people use a certain technology, the more valuable it becomes for each user to also use that technology.Another important aspect of network economics is the concept of critical mass, which refers to the point at which a network reaches a certain number of users and its value starts to increase rapidly, this point is called a \"tipping point\". Once a network reaches critical mass, it can be difficult for new entrants to compete, as the established network is more valuable to users. This is the reason why it's often hard for new social networks to gain traction, because users tend to prefer networks with many users.Network economics also applies to the design and pricing of networks, pricing models in networks are different than traditional goods and services, since value increases as more users join, businesses have to take into account these effects when designing their pricing strategy, this is known as two-sided markets, where companies need to balance the value they offer to different type of users.Overall, network economics is concerned with understanding the dynamics of network effects and how they impact economic behavior and outcomes. It's important for businesses operating in digital sectors to understand the principles of network economics, in order to develop products and services that can achieve critical mass, offer value to their customers and maintain a competitive advantage.How information system affects quality of life?Information systems can have a significant impact on the quality of life, both positively and negatively.Positive effects:Convenience: Information systems can make many aspects of daily life more convenient, by providing access to information and services from any location, at any time. For example, online shopping and banking, allow people to access goods and services without having to leave their homes.Connectivity: Information systems can increase connectivity and communication among people, fostering social interactions and promoting community building. For example, social networking sites and instant messaging platforms allow people to connect with friends and family from anywhere in the world.Healthcare: Information systems can improve healthcare by providing easy access to medical information, enabling remote monitoring of patients and allowing medical professionals to share patient data and collaborate more effectively.Education: Information systems can enhance education by providing students with access to online resources, online courses and online tutoring, and allowing for remote learning.Negative effects:Isolation: Over-reliance on information systems can lead to social isolation and a decreased sense of community, as people spend more time interacting online and less time interacting in person.Cybercrime: Information systems can also make people vulnerable to cybercrime, such as identity theft, hacking, and online fraud, which can cause financial and emotional stress.Privacy: Information systems can also pose a threat to privacy, as personal information can be collected, shared, and used without an individual's knowledge or consent.Cyberbullying: Cyberbullying is the act of bullying through electronic technology, which can be highly detrimental to the well-being of both the bully and the victim.It's important to note that these effects can be managed by proper use of Information systems and security measures, encouraging education and awareness on the benefits and risks of using information systems, making sure that users are protected against potential harms. Moreover, it's important to have regulations and laws that promote the responsible and ethical use of information systems, and to provide users with tools to manage the privacy and security of their personal information.Explain the conversion process of system development.The system development process is a methodical and systematic approach to creating, deploying and maintaining information systems. The process typically consists of several phases, each with its specific objectives and deliverables. The conversion process is a critical phase in the system development process, it's the stage of moving from the old system to the new one. Specifically, the conversion process refers to the activities involved in converting data and processes from an existing system to a new system.The conversion process typically includes the following steps:Planning: The first step is to develop a detailed plan that outlines the scope of the conversion, the resources required, the timelines, and the risks involved.Data analysis: The next step is to analyze the existing data and processes, in order to determine the data elements that need to be converted, the relationships between data elements, and any data integrity constraints.Data mapping: Data mapping is the process of matching the data elements from the old system to the new system, this step is critical to ensure data consistency and integrity during the conversion process.Data validation: After data mapping is completed, the data is validated to ensure that it meets the requirements of the new system, this can be done through testing, reviewing and cleaning the data.Data conversion: Once the data has been validated, it can be loaded into the new system. This step typically involves creating scripts or programs to automate the process of loading the data into the new system.Testing: After the data has been converted, the new system is tested to ensure that it functions properly and that the data has been converted accurately.Deployment: After the system has been tested, it's deployed to the production environment, this is the step where users start using the new system, it can be a phased deployment or a \"big bang\" switchover.MaintenanceExplain information system from functional prospective An information system (IS) is a set of hardware, software, and people that work together to collect, process, store, and disseminate information. From a functional perspective, an information system can be divided into four main components: input, processing, output, and feedback.Input: This component is responsible for collecting data and information from internal and external sources, such as employees, customers, or external partners. Examples of input devices include keyboard, barcode scanner, microphone, and GPS.Processing: This component is responsible for processing the data and information that is collected by the input component. It includes hardware, software, and people that process, analyze, and transform the data into useful information. This can include tasks such as sorting, calculating, and comparing data.Output: This component is responsible for delivering the processed information to the appropriate users or systems. Examples of output devices include monitor, printers, speakers, and email.Feedback: This component is responsible for providing information about the system's performance and the outcomes of its operations. This information is used to make decisions and adjustments to the system, to improve its performance and adapt to changing needs. Feedback can be in form of error messages, notifications, or performance reports.Together, these components work to support an organization's operations, decision-making, and learning processes by providing accurate, timely and relevant information. Information systems can be divided into various types based on their purpose, these include: operational systems, management systems, and strategic systems. Operational systems focus on day-to-day tasks such as data entry and transaction processing, management systems focus on decision making and controlling, and strategic systems focus on long-term planning and competitiveness.Functional perspective on information systems is important as it provides a clear understanding of the different components and their interrelated roles. This allows organizations to identify where improvements are needed and to develop solutions that increase the effectiveness and efficiency of their information systems.What are the change management challenges for business process re-engineering?Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) is the radical redesign of business processes to achieve significant improvements in performance. While BPR can bring significant benefits to an organization, such as improved efficiency, increased productivity and cost savings, it can also present several change management challenges. These include:Resistance to change: Employees may be resistant to change, especially if they are used to working in a certain way and are comfortable with the current processes. They may not understand the need for change or may be afraid of losing their jobs.Lack of buy-in from employees: Employees may not be fully committed to the BPR effort and may lack the necessary motivation to embrace the changes. This can lead to lack of support for the project and slow adoption of new processes.Limited understanding of the new processes: Employees may not have a clear understanding of the new processes, which can cause confusion and slow down the implementation of the changes.Complexity of BPR: BPR can be a complex process, involving many different stages and stakeholders. This complexity can make it difficult to manage the project effectively and can increase the risk of errors or delays.Limited resources: BPR projects often require significant investment in terms of time, money, and resources. Organizations may not have the necessary resources to implement the changes, which can impede the progress of the project.Communication challenges: Effective communication is critical for successful BPR, yet it can be a challenge to communicate the details of changes to all stakeholders involved.Adapting to new technology: Changes may involve new technology that employees may not be familiar with or may need retraining. This can lead to additional costs and time in the implementation process.To overcome these challenges, organizations need to develop a comprehensive change management plan that addresses these issues, it should include steps such as communication, training, employee involvement, and support to ensure the smooth transition to the new processes. Furthermore, it's important to have a clear sense of the expected outcome, benefits and ROI and communicate it clearly to all stakeholders.What is portfolio analysis in 2 sentencesPortfolio analysis is a process of evaluating a collection of investments in order to assess their overall performance and to identify areas for improvement. It involves analyzing and measuring the risk, return, and diversification of the portfolio in order to align it with an investor's goals and risk tolerance.Discuss some internet security challenges to IS?The internet has revolutionized the way we conduct business, share information, and connect with each other. However, it has also introduced new security challenges for organizations. These include:Hacking: The internet makes it easy for hackers to gain unauthorized access to systems and networks, steal sensitive information and disrupt operations.Malware: Malicious software such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses can be easily spread over the internet and cause serious damage to systems and networks.Phishing: Scammers use fraudulent emails and websites to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and Social Security numbers.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): Hackers use botnets to flood a website or network with traffic, overwhelming the system and making it unavailable to legitimate users.Advanced Persistent Threat (APT): APT is a type of cyber-attack that is conducted by highly-skilled and well-funded adversaries who are able to evade traditional security defenses and remain undetected for prolonged periods of time.Cloud security: More organizations are using cloud services to store and process data, it has introduced new security challenges such as configuring security settings correctly, monitoring and managing access to data, and protecting data during transmission and at rest.IoT security: Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more prevalent and they can offer many benefits, yet they also raise security concerns, including insecure default settings, a lack of security features, and a lack of standardization.These challenges can put organizations at risk of data breaches, loss of intellectual property, and financial losses. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement robust security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, antivirus software, and security policies, as well as regularly testing and updating their security systems and educating employees about security best practices.Explain the importance of TPS in points Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) are computerized systems that process business transactions in order to update and retrieve data in a database. TPS are important for businesses because they:Streamline processes: TPS automate repetitive, routine tasks, such as data entry, which reduces the risk of errors and improves the speed and efficiency of the process.Increase data accuracy: TPS automatically validate, process and record transactions, which reduces the risk of errors caused by manual data entry.Enhance decision-making: TPS provide real-time data on the status of business transactions, which can be used to make informed decisions.Improve customer service: TPS allow businesses to respond quickly and accurately to customer requests, which can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.Enhance security: TPS have built-in security features that help prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.Facilitate compliance: TPS can provide the necessary records and reports to support compliance with various regulatory requirements, such as financial reporting and tax compliance.Increase scalability and adaptability: TPS can be customized and integrated with other systems, making it easy to scale and adapt to changing business needs.Provide real-time data: TPS provide real-time data and analytics that enable businesses to track, manage and control business processes and performance.In summary, TPS are essential for businesses to operate efficiently, effectively and securely. They automate, integrate and accelerate business processes, improving accuracy, speed and decision making capabilities, that can contribute to a competitive edge and a better customer service. explain why computer system are vulnerable to attack? Computer systems are vulnerable to attack because of a combination of factors, including:Complexity: Modern computer systems are highly complex, with many different components and layers of software, hardware and networks that can be exploited by attackers.Connectivity: Computer systems are increasingly connected to the internet and other networks, making it easier for attackers to access them remotely.Lack of security updates: Software vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers, but they are often fixed by software updates. If systems are not updated, they can remain vulnerable to attack.Human error: People are an important part of any system and as a result, they can make mistakes, such as falling for phishing scams, using weak passwords, or sharing sensitive information with unauthorized parties.Social engineering: Many attacks rely on tricking people into giving away information or access. Techniques such as phishing, baiting, and pretexting are all ways attackers take advantage of human vulnerabilities.Configuration errors: Many systems are configured with a \"default\" set of settings, and if these settings are not changed, they can create security vulnerabilities.Third-party software: Many systems rely on third-party software and services, such as libraries, plugins, and APIs, and if one of these components is compromised, it can open a way for an attacker.Increasing complexity of attacks: cybercriminals are constantly improving their skills and tools, making it more difficult for organizations to keep up with evolving threats.Computer systems are not a fixed entity and they are always evolving and changing, which means that vulnerabilities can be found and exploited. Organizations must continuously monitor and protect their systems, which includes keeping software up to date, educating employees about security best practices and implementing security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software.Define OLAP in one sentence OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is a category of software tools that enables multidimensional analysis of data stored in relational databases.Define goal seeking analysis one sentence Goal Seeking Analysis is a method used to determine the input value that would result in a specific target output value for a given mathematical model or formula.Define distributed database in Two sentence A Distributed Database is a database that is spread across multiple computers and/or locations, allowing multiple users to access and manipulate the data simultaneously. It is designed to improve performance and availability by distributing data and processing workloads across multiple resources.Explain the components of IS An Information System (IS) is a combination of hardware, software, and people that work together to collect, process, store, and disseminate information. The main components of an IS are:Hardware: This includes the physical components of the system, such as servers, desktops, laptops, smartphones, and other devices that are used to collect, store and process data.Software: This includes the programs and applications that run on the hardware, such as operating systems, databases, and specialized software that support the specific functions of the system.Data: This includes the information that is collected, stored, and processed by the system. This can include structured data, such as that found in databases, as well as unstructured data, such as text, images, and videos.Procedures: This includes the procedures and processes used to operate and maintain the system, such as backup and recovery procedures, security protocols, and system administration tasks.People: This includes the individuals who use, operate, and maintain the system, such as end-users, system administrators, and IT professionals.Network: In many IS the communication between the different components is done through the network, which can be wired, wireless, or both. The network is responsible for connecting the different components together and allows them to communicate and exchange data.All these components are interrelated and work together to support an organization's operations, decision-making, and learning processes by providing accurate, timely and relevant information. The effectiveness of an IS depends on how well the components work together and how well they support the needs of the organization.How a company can become agile? Agile refers to a set of principles and practices that prioritize flexibility, speed, and customer focus in the development and delivery of products and services. To become more agile, a company can take several steps, including:Emphasize cross-functional teams: Organize teams around specific projects or products rather than specific functions, this will increase collaboration and communication among team members and allow for faster problem solving.Encourage open communication: Foster an environment of open communication across all levels of the organization to ensure that everyone is aware of the company's goals and objectives.Prioritize customer needs: Understand the needs of your customers and focus on delivering value to them as quickly as possible, this will help the company to react quickly to market changes or customer requirements.Embrace failure: Recognize that failure is a part of the learning process and use it as an opportunity to learn and improve.Implement continuous improvement: Encourage the organization to continuously improve through the use of metrics and regular retrospectives to identify areas of improvementEmbrace change: Be open to change and adapt to new technologies, trends, and market conditions.Use Agile methodologies: implement frameworks like Scrum, Kanban or Lean to manage projects and deliver results.By following these steps, companies can become more agile and better able to respond to the rapidly changing business environment. Agile companies are more adaptable, more responsive, and more innovative than those that are not. It is important to note that it's a continuous journey, becoming Agile is not a one-time event, it requires a culture change and continuous improvement.explain value chain of a firm!Too many requests in 1 hour.

YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0\n![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0)\n## Transcript:\n- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=0s) welcome to the eponymous novel podcast the main topic that we started out on was timeless principles of wealth creation and then we've been touching a little bit on internal happiness and peace and well-being but i am first and foremost a student of science and failed physicist if you will i loved physics i wanted to pursue it but i never felt i was going to be great at it and i was pulled into more technology which is applied science nevertheless i've remained a student of science i remain fascinated by it and\n- [00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=27s) all of my real heroes are scientists because i believe that science is the engine that pulls humanity forward i've been lucky to live in an age where scientific progress and technological progress seem not likely but inevitable so we've gotten used to this idea that life always gets better despite all the complaining that goes on about how productivity growth is stagnant the reality is anyone who owns a smartphone or drives a car or even lives in a house has seen technology improve their quality of life\n- [00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=55s) over and over again we take this progress for granted and it's thanks to science so i continue to be fascinated by science and to me science is also the study of truth what do we know to be true how do we know something to be true and as i get older i find myself incapable of having attention span for anything which is not steeped in truth so the background on this particular podcast series is i thought i knew a lot about science and there was a lot about science that i took for granted such as what scientific\n- [01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=86s) theory is and how scientific theories are formed most of us have a vague idea of it and it can range from some people think science is what scientists do which has a definitional problem as in what is a scientist and other people think well science is making falsifiable or testable predictions and maybe that's closer to it and then sometimes people say what's the scientific method and what is the scientific method and then they start describing their junior high school chemistry experiment and lose the trail after that especially in\n- [01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=114s) these days where we're told to quote unquote believe in science which is an oxymoron people respect science but they don't understand what science is the idea of what science is is getting hijacked sometimes by well-meaning people who want to convince you of the science and sometimes by not so well-meaning people who just want to influence the way that you think and feel and act i was very pleasantly surprised a couple of years back that i reopened an old book which i had read or i thought i'd read about a decade ago called the\n- [02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=141s) beginning of infinity by david deutsch sometimes you read a book and it makes a difference right away sometimes you read a book and you don't understand it then you read it later at the right time and it makes a difference this time when i reopened this book and i went through it much more carefully than i had in the past meticulously rather than reading it to read it and to say i was done reading it i read it to understand the concepts and the topics and stopped at every point where something was new it completely started reforming my\n- [02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=169s) worldview it changed the way that i think and i would credit this book as being probably the only book in the last decade except maybe a few of nasim teleb's works and maybe one or two other scatter books that i feel made me smarter they literally expanded the way that i think they expanded not just the repertoire of my knowledge but the repertoire of my reasoning people throw around words like mental models a lot and i find most mental models not worth reading or thinking about or listening to because i find them trivial however the\n- [03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=198s) mental models that came out of the beginning of infinity are transformational because they very convincingly completely change the way that you look at what is true and what is not karl popper laid out the theory of what is scientific and what is not what is a good explanation what is not and what deutsch does is he expands on that dramatically in the beginning of infinity but even that is to do it a disservice the wide-ranging nature of what he covers in the beginning of infinity is incredible he goes from the theory of\n- [03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=227s) knowledge which goes by the fancy word epistemology all the way to quantum mechanics and physics and multiverse theory to infinity and mathematics to the reach of what is noble and what is not noble universal explanations the theory of computation what is beauty what systems of politics works better how to raise your children these are all encompassing long-range philosophical ideas the beginning of infinity is not an easy book to read to some level deutsche could not but write for other physicists he has a certain peer group that he\n- [04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=260s) respects and who respect him and he has to meet them at their level so he has to write for other physicists and philosophers part of what i wanted to do was i wanted to understand these principles in the book verify confirm them for myself or not i love the old motto from the royal society which says nullius and verba which says take no one's word for it in other words figure it out yourself that's the only way you know anything so i wanted to confirm the principles in the beginning of infinity or to refute\n- [04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=287s) them for myself so to do that i was reading and rereading the book i started reading some blog posts on it and then eventually i found a guy online named brett hall and i started listening to his podcast which was called talk cast but tok cast for the theory of knowledge cast and brett i'm going to let you introduce yourself but i would say that listening to your podcast has helped me clarify a lot of these principles and i would love to have you talk with me so that we can both understand the depth the clarity the reach the importance of\n- [05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=319s) these ideas and then hopefully someone else out there can become smarter by it hello naval and it's great to be here you've raised so many interesting aspects of the beginning of infinity which has become a real passion of mine like many people who enter into science when i was at school i thought well i want to be an astronomer when i enter university i want to go and do a physics degree do an astronomy degree and then become a professional astronomer it wasn't until one day i was in a bookstore and i found\n- [05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=348s) this book called the fabric of reality by david deutsch and i started reading it and the first chapter described what i was trying to achieve in my life it was putting into words what i felt my university studies what my general outlook on life was about because david deutsch says there the ancient philosophers thought that they could get an understanding of the entire world and then later on as time passed modern science made it seem as though this was an impossible project there's no way you could understand everything\n- [06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=381s) about reality there's too much to know how could you possibly know everything david deutsch presents at the beginning of the fabric of reality this idea that you don't need to know absolutely every single fact that needs to be known in order to understand fundamentally everything that can be understood he was presenting this vision there are certain fundamental theories in science and outside of science and his four theories that he had were quantum theory the theory of computation the theory of epistemology\n- [06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=409s) and evolution by natural selection that these together formed a world view a lens through which you could understand anything that could be understood i saw a beautiful video with him on youtube where he was making the same points where he was saying you don't have to memorize and know every fact you don't have to know where every particle moved but if you understand the deep underlying theories behind everything then you know at a high level how everything works and this can all be understood by a single person\n- [07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=440s) a single brain a single human being it's accessible to anybody and that is a jaw-droppingly powerful idea we can have explanations that can reach the entire universe and it's worth going through the four that you'd mentioned quantum theory is one of them theory of computation is another one of them the theory of evolution is another one of them and then the theory of knowledge or epistemology is the fourth that's the way he presented it in fabric of reality is it interesting that relativity is not\n- [07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=471s) in there he regards quantum theory as being deeper than the theory of relativity at some point most physicists expect that we're going to have a unification of quantum theory and relativity it's not to say that in that world view that we're dismissing relativity but his guess is that quantum theory will be more foundational than what the theory of relativity is there'll be a space time of the multiverse that's why relativity doesn't appear amongst them the beginning of infinity reminds me the\n- [08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=502s) most of godalesherbach as a book in that it's very wide-ranging it stitches together ideas from many different disciplines it's very difficult to understand and follow completely everyone claims to have read it but as far as i can tell very few people understand it i had this experience in college where i first found go to lescherbach and i remember that i put on my bookshelf and i started reading it and started reading it started reading it about a year later i was probably about halfway through it and then i just ran out of\n- [08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=528s) time and other things going on and i remember that i would approach my other friends in college and i would say either this is a great book you should read it or i would say have you read it and they'd all say yeah yeah that's great and a week later they'd roll back and say yeah red go to leicester buck it was great and i felt like the stupidest person in college and it was only years later that i realized nobody has read it as you get older you get more confident in those confessionals where you either\n- [09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=550s) say either i didn't read it or i read it at a constant pace and when i encountered something i didn't understand i kept going i went back much later and i still confess to this day i have not read all of god lescherbach but at least at this point i went through and i found the parts that were most interesting to me which were the godel parts and skipped the ones that were not as interesting to me which were the bach parts and i did read those and i did try and understand them the beginning of infinity is similar\n- [09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=575s) everybody has it on their bookshelf in my social circle many claim to have read it but very few have gotten it i do go back to this point that was first eloquently stated on twitter by a character named illa certain where he said i don't want to read all the books i just want to read the best 100 over and over again and i would say that i'm currently stuck in a loop where at least in science i am only going to read the beginning of infinity and the fabric of reality over and over again until i understand\n- [10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=600s) them fully if i had read them 20 years ago i would know a lot more because then i would have chosen the right books and the right authors to read subsequently it's going to be a hard book to follow you should buy a hardcover and electronics so you have both and the audio get in every way possible if you can get through it on the first sitting and understand all the points at a deep level then congratulations but we're hoping to break it down for you the difference with the beginning of infinity you're\n- [10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=624s) getting a world view you're not being given the standard take from physicists about how to understand quantum theory you're not being given the standard take of how to understand knowledge from philosophers and you're certainly not being given the standard take of how to understand mathematics for mathematicians deutsche is qualified in all these areas he's expert in all these areas so the world view itself what's at the core of it deutsche's world view is that reality is comprehensible problems are\n- [10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=651s) soluble it's a deeply rationally optimistic worldview it believes in good explanations good scientific explanations and progress progress is inevitable as long as we have these good explanations good explanations have tremendous reach they are acts of creativity humans are problem solvers and can solve all problems all sins and evil are due to a lack of knowledge one can be optimistic about constant progress that's what the title the beginning of infinity refers to that we're the beginning of an infinite series of\n- [11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=684s) progress it's a very optimistic take it believes that we are at home in the universe the universe is ours as a resource to learn about and exploit that material wealth is a set of physical transformations that we can affect that everything that is not forbidden by the laws of physics is eventually possible through knowledge and knowledge creation he also talks about how humans are universal explainers that anything that can be known and understood can be known and understood by human beings in the computation power of a\n- [11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=712s) human system it's all noble it's all noble by humans we're the beginning of an infinity of knowledge and as we understand things using good explanations and we create new theories that are constantly being destroyed and replaced by better ones there's no end point in sight there's no perfection every theory can be falsified and improved that we are on our way to being able to do everything that is not forbidden by the laws of physics what does the transforming is knowledge we can take some raw material that had\n- [12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=744s) no particular use and within that raw material we might find uranium nuclei which then can be used in a nuclear reactor to create energy or bombs we can find within something that for almost the entire geological existence of the earth sat there inert and would have done nothing absent people people are the entities within the universe that create explanations they're able to explain what raw materials might be transformed into now what are they transforming these raw materials into civilization people creating knowledge\n- [12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=778s) end up becoming literally a force of nature if we seek to explain something like the shape of a galaxy or the shape of the star any astrophysicist will give you a story based upon the known laws of physics about how gravity will pull things into spheres how the laws of thermodynamics will cause certain kinds of gas to heat up and expand all of the known laws of physics are sufficient to explain what we see out there in the cosmos but the laws of physics alone will not be able to explain the appearance of manhattan you have to invoke things\n- [13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=813s) other than merely the fundamental laws of physics you need to invoke the existence of people and their capacity to explain the world scientifically philosophically politically because it's all of those things that will come together to explain why we have certain structures like skyscrapers in manhattan this is a profound idea it's an idea that seems to have been overlooked by scientists many of whom have a reductionist idea about how to explain what we see in our environment they will seek to explain only the\n- [14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=847s) natural phenomena that are in our environment of course everyone wants to know how the laws of nature work but if we want to understand how the universe from this point onwards whether it's locally on our own planet eventually the solar system eventually the galaxy is going to evolve over time we're going to have to talk about the knowledge that people create and the choices that they're going to make into the future this is a different vision of the place of people in the universe stephen hawking famously said people are\n- [14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=879s) nothing special people in chemical scum on a very typical planet orbiting an average star in the outer suburbs a very typical galaxy which is one among hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe this vision of what people are and of what the planet earth is it's true in a trivial sense but it misses the point that in people are a hub of a kind we are so far as we know the sole place in the universe which is creating knowledge an open-ended stream of knowledge that could transform the rest of reality in the\n- [15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=914s) same way that gravity is able to pull that galaxy into a particular shape knowledge in the future will be able to shape the course of the planet the solar system eventually the galaxy we will have this profound impact upon everything that we can see around us and there's nothing that the laws of physics the laws of chemistry or even the laws of biology can predict what is going to happen in the future the attempt to predict the future growth of knowledge is impossible that's the nature of knowledge because\n- [15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=947s) knowledge creation is genuinely an act of creation it is bringing something into existence that wasn't there prior if you could predict it you would have invented it already a lot of our deeply pessimistic world views come from a straight line linear extrapolation of negative trends while ignoring positive trends and positive trends mostly come through creativity and knowledge creation and it's inherently unpredictable so every generation has this doomsayers and cassandras the modern malthusians who say on this\n- [16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=976s) trajectory we're all gonna die they're very popular for the same reason that zombie movies and vampire movies are popular but the reality is that they cannot predict what we're going to do in the future that is going to improve our quality of life and save us from inevitable ruin the value is in the knowledge and the knowledge is inside the observer and the creator in other words the human it's not inside the thing itself for example oil is useless unless you know how to refine it burn it and use it for\n- [16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1003s) combustion information is useless unless there's a brand there to receive it there could be a signal broadcasting english into outer space but if there isn't a creature capable of understanding what that language is how it works and who's conveying it then it's just modulated electromagnetic frequencies that don't mean anything so a lot of the information and a lot of the value is within a particular knowledge bearing entity as science grows its reach we've gotten to a very reductive science where we\n- [17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1030s) break things down to smaller and smaller pieces and then we try and explain things on the basis of that and there is a counter trend in science which is complexity theory where we talk about emergent properties and higher level systems where we're starting to now look at systems as they operate chaotically and unpredictably at a micro level but at a macro level we can make certain statements about them that do have explanatory power so humans are unique in our capability to understand things there's a phrase that you're going to\n- [17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1057s) hear both brett and i use over and over again and that phrase has good explanations good explanations is deutsche's improvement upon the scientific method at the same time it's beyond science it's not just true in science but in all of life we navigate our way through life and we do it successfully by creating good explanations if you take away nothing else try and understand what a good explanation is a good explanation first and foremost is testifiable falsifiable you can run some experiment in the real world\n- [18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1092s) to see if it's true or not stepping back from that it's a creative explanation it looks at something that's going on in the real world and says this is why it's happening it is a creative leap that says this is the underlying explanation for how the thing works for example when i talk to my young kids and we're out watching the sunset i keep telling them is the sun setting is the sun going somewhere is the sun moving or is it maybe we're moving and we're moving in such a way that it looks like\n- [18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1117s) the sun is setting which is the proper explanation because looking at it naively you would think the sun is hurtling across the sky and there goes the sun again going around the earth but that may not be the only explanation there is a completely creative explanation that seems to fly in the face of the obvious observation of the sun's movement but could also fit the facts but it requires some creativity and that creative explanation is that the earth is rotating good explanations don't have to be obvious they're not\n- [19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1145s) derived from just looking at what happened in the past but they are testable there are experiments we can run to figure out is it the sun that is growing around the earth or is it the earth turning brett would you say that a scientific theory is a subset of a good explanation yes they're the testable kinds of good explanations falsifiable theories are actually a dime a dozen this doesn't tell you anything about the quality of the explanation you're being given the example that's used in the fabric of\n- [19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1172s) reality is the grass cure for the common cold if someone comes along to you and says if you eat 1.0 kilograms of grass it will cure your common cold they have a testable theory the problem is that no one should test it why because they haven't given you an explanation as to what the mechanism is that would enable grass to cure the common cold and if you do eat the 1.\n- [19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1198s) 0 kilograms of grass and it doesn't cure your cold they can turn around and say 1.1 kilograms might do it right or you need a different kind of grass or you need to always do it on a different day it's always testable but you're not getting anywhere you're not making any progress so i think the second piece of good explanation is hard to vary it has to be very precise and there's a good reason for the precision the famous example he used in the beginning of infinity is the why do we have seasons on the earth and\n- [20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1225s) there was the old greek explanation well it's driven by persephone the goddess of spring that's when she can leave hades and there's this whole theory involving gods and goddesses not only was that not easily testable it was very easy to vary persephone could have been nike and hades could have been jupiter or zeus it's very easy to vary that explanation without the predictions changing whereas if you look at the axis tilt theory of saying the earth is angled at 23 degrees relative to the sun and\n- [20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1250s) therefore would expect the sun to rise here in the winter and over there in the summer the facts on that are very hard to vary it makes risky and narrow predictions they can predict the exact length of summer and winter at different latitudes and you can test that very precisely so beyond it being a creative theory that is testable and falsifiable it should be hard to vary the pieces of that theory without essentially destroying that theory and you certainly don't want to vary it after the fact like your grass example oh it was one\n- [21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1279s) kilogram now it's 1.1 now it's 1.2 finally the predictions that it makes should be very narrow and precise and they should be risky for example i believe in relativity was it eddington who did the experiment and showed that star light gets bent around an eclipse and that was a prediction that einstein had made in relativity which turned out to be true that was a risky prediction that took a long time to confirm that's an excellent example of what's called a crucial test which is sort of the pinnacle of what science is all\n- [21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1307s) about if we do a test and it doesn't agree with a particular theory that we have that's problematic but that doesn't mean that it refutes the theory because if you were to refute the only theory that you have where do you jump to you don't have any alternative if we were to do a scientific test tomorrow and it was inconsistent with the theory of general relativity then what there is no alternative to general relativity in fact when there have been experiments over the years that seem to have been\n- [22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1336s) inconsistent with general relativity guess what they've all turned out to be faulty if you had to choose between whether or not general relativity has been refuted by your test or your test is flawed go with the fact that your test is being flawed in the case of eddington's experiment we had two viable theories for what gravity was we had newton's theory of universal gravitation on the one hand and we had einstein's general theory of relativity on the other this experiment that you described of how much the light was bent during a\n- [22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1363s) solar eclipse the correct way of describing what happened is not that we showed that general relativity was correct in some final sense but rather we refuted newton's theory of gravitation newton's theory was ruled out because it was inconsistent with the test while general relativity was consistent with the test this doesn't mean that general relativity is the final word in science it means it is the best theory we have for now and there's a whole bunch of reasons that we might think general relativity\n- [23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1390s) ultimately has to turn out false we never have the final word and that's a good thing that's a really positive optimistic thing because it means we can keep on improving we can keep on making progress and we keep on discovering new things there is no end of science the long thought about idea that so many have feared that one day progress will come to a halt that science will end in fact we are at the beginning of infinity and we will always be at the beginning of infinity precisely because we can improve\n- [23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1418s) our ideas because we're fallible human beings so none of our theories are perfect because we aren't and our process by which we create knowledge isn't perfect either it's error-prone there are two other scientific thinkers that i like who are unrelated to david deutsch but come to very similar conclusions one is nasim taleb who's popularized the idea of the black swan which is that no number of white swans disproves the existence of a black swan you can never conclusively say all swans are white you can never\n- [24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1447s) establish final truth all you can do is work with the best explanation you have today which is still better than ignorance far better but at any time a black swan can show up and disprove your theory and then you have to go find a better one the other fellow who i find fascinating is gregory chaitan he is a mathematician who is very much in the curt girdle vein where he tries to explore the limits and boundaries of what is possible in mathematics one of the points that he makes is that godel's incompleteness theorem\n- [24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1477s) doesn't say that mathematics is junk it's not a cause for despair gordo's incompleteness theorem says that no formal system including mathematics it can be both complete and correct either there are statements that are true that cannot be proven true in the system or there will be a contradiction somewhere inside the system so this could be a cause of despair for mathematicians who view mathematics as this abstract perfect fully self-contained thing but chetan makes the argument that actually it opens up for creativity in\n- [25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1508s) mathematics it means that even in mathematics you are always one step away from falsifying something and then finding a better explanation for it it puts humans and their creativity and their ability to find good explanations back at the core of it at some deep level mathematics is still an art there's very useful things that come out of mathematics and you're still building an edifice of knowledge but there is no such thing as conclusive settled truth there is no subtle science there is no settled mathematics there\n- [25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1536s) are good explanations that will be replaced over time with more good explanations that explain more of the world this is something that we inherit from our schooling more than anything else it's part of our academic culture and breeds into the wider culture as well people have this idea that mathematics is this pristine area of knowledge where what has proved to be true is certainly true then you have science which doesn't give you certain truth but you can be highly confident in what you discover you can use experiments to confirm\n- [26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1567s) that what you're saying appears to be correct but you might be wrong and then of course there's philosophy which is a mere matter of opinion this is the hierarchy that some people inherit from school mathematics are certain science is almost certain and the rest of it is more or less a matter of opinion this is what deutsch calls the mathematician's misconception is that mathematicians have this intuitive way of realizing that their proof their theorem that they've reached by this method of proof is absolutely certainly true\n- [26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1596s) in fact it's a confusion between the subject matter and our knowledge of the subject matter if i quickly compare it to physics we have this domain called particle physics and the deepest theory we have in particle physics is called the standard model which describes all of the different fundamental particles that there are and the interactions between these fundamental particles the forces that exist between them and the gauge bosons which mediate the force between particles like electrons protons and neutrons now\n- [27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1627s) what is matter made of we would say matter is made of these particles the particles described by the standard model of physics but does that rule out the fact that these fundamental particles might themselves consist of even smaller particles we have this idea of string theory so our knowledge of what the most fundamental particles are and what in reality the most fundamental particles are is different so too in mathematics deutsche explains that mathematics is a field where what we're trying to uncover is necessary truth\n- [27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1660s) the subject matter of mathematics is necessary truth in the same way that the subject matter of particle physics are the fundamental particles but because the subject matter of fundamental particle physics are the fundamental particles that doesn't mean you actually find the fundamental particles all it means is that you have found the smallest particles that your biggest particle accelerators are able to resolve but if you had an even bigger particle accelerator you might find particles within those particles this has been the\n- [28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1687s) history of particle physics by the way we used to think that atoms were fundamental then of course we found that they contain nuclei and electrons in the nuclei we found out there were protons and neutrons inside the protons and neutrons we found out they were made up of quarks and that's where we're at right now we're at the point where we say that the quarks are fundamental and the electrons are fundamental but that doesn't mean that we're going to end particle physics right now what we need are further theories about\n- [28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1712s) what might be inside of those really small particles comparing that to mathematics if necessary truth is the subject matter of mathematics our knowledge of that necessary truth is what mathematicians are engaged in they're engaged in creating knowledge about necessary truth and because a mathematician has a brain which is a physical object and all physical objects are subject to making errors of degradation via the second law of thermodynamics or simply just the usual mental mistakes and errors that any human being makes a\n- [29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1747s) mathematician is just as fallible as anyone else then what they end up proving could be an error so if i understand this point even mathematics is capable of error because mathematics is a creative act we're never quite done there could have been a mistake in your axiom somewhere ultimately even mathematics is a creative act and can have error within it all knowledge is conjectural it's always being guessed it's our best understanding at any given time you're right to say that the axioms might be incorrect\n- [29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1779s) how do we know that an axiom is incorrect traditionally the answer has been because it's clearly and obviously the case how can you prove that x plus 0 must equal x well you just have to accept that it's true but if we consider something like euclid's elements for example draw two points on a piece of paper now through those two points a unique straight line can be drawn this was accepted as true for centuries when anyone listening might want to try the experiment for themselves take a piece of paper take a pen draw\n- [30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1813s) two dots on the piece of paper now how many unique straight lines can you draw through those two dots it should be fairly obvious to you that only one such line can be drawn however we now know that's false i just want you to reflect as you're staring at the piece of paper through which only one straight line is being drawn you have the feeling of certainty you are absolutely sure that you're not wrong this feeling is something we should always be skeptical of because when people have been absolutely\n- [30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1845s) certain even in a domain as apparently full of certainty as mathematics they've been shown to be wrong so how can we show it wrong here's what you do and you might think that i'm cheating but then again you have to reflect on did you understand what i was saying when i first told you to draw a unique straight line through these two points here's what i want you to do bend the piece of paper think in three dimensions wrap the piece of paper around a basketball if you have one now consider the ways in which you could\n- [31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1874s) draw a straight line through those two points you could punch a hole through one of those dots with your pen and push it out through the other side through the other hole and now you have a different straight line you have the straight line that is drawn with your pen and you have a straight line that is literally your pen that has been pushed through these two dots so your initial feeling of absolute certainty that only a unique line could be drawn through these two dots is false and you might be thinking that's unfair that's cheating you were\n- [31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1903s) thinking in two dimensions no you were thinking in two dimensions i wasn't i was thinking of more dimensions than that karl popper has this wonderful saying it is impossible to speak in such a way that you cannot be misunderstood this is always the case so even in mathematics where we try and be as precise as possible it's possible for people to make errors to think false premises about what the argument is that they're trying to make and by the way this particular example of euclidean geometry because geometry\n- [32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1931s) was traditionally always done in two dimensions on a piece of paper was resolved by various people and led to geometry in curved space which led to einstein coming up with general theory of relativity so it is questioning these deepest assumptions that we have where we think there's no possible way we could be mistaken that leads to true progress to genuine fundamental change in the sciences and everywhere else you said that we went from atoms in the time of democritus down to nuclei and from there to protons and neutrons\n- [32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1964s) and then to quarks it's particles all the way down to paraphrase feynman we can keep going forever but it's not quite forever right at some point you run it into the planck length there's the planck time there's the plank length there's even the plank mass which is actually quite a large mass these things don't have any physical significance it's not like the planck time is the shortest possible time and it's not like the plank length is the shortest possible length the reason for that is because these\n- [33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=1991s) planck things are part of quantum theory but length is not described by quantum theory it's described by the general theory of relativity and in that theory space is infinitely divisible there is no smallest possible length or time this illuminates an ancient tension between the discrete and the continuous because quantum theory seems to suggest that things are discrete for example there's a smallest possible particle of gold the gold atom there's a smallest possible particle of electricity the electron there's a\n- [33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2025s) smallest possible particle of light the photon in quantum theory we have this idea of discreteness that there is a smallest possible thing from which everything else is built but in general relativity the idea is the opposite it says things can continuously vary and if the mathematics requires that things be continuously variable so they can be differentiated and so on the idea there is that you can keep on dividing up space and you can keep on dividing up time so physicists understand that there is this contradiction\n- [34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2056s) at the deepest level of our most foundational explanations in physics and it's one of the reasons why there are these attempts to try and unify quantum theory and general relativity because what is the fundamental nature of reality is it that things can be infinitely divisible or is it that we must stop somewhere or other because if it's infinitely divisible then quantum theory might have to be subservient to general relativity but we just don't know there goes my solution for zeno's paradox which is before you can get all\n- [34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2088s) the way somewhere you have to get halfway there and before you can get halfway there you have to get a quarter of the way there and therefore you'll never get there one way to get past that is say even a series of infinite things can have a finite sum just run the infinite series and sum it and we learned pretty early on that converges but another thought i had was that you have to cover a minimum distance a plank length and therefore you will get there it's a finite series of steps but you're saying we just don't know\n- [35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2110s) yes so if the laws of physics say that we can cover one meter in a certain time period then that's exactly what we'll do and our current understanding of the laws of physics say precisely that so zeno's paradox is resolved simply by saying that we can cover this space in this amount of time it's silent on whether or not space is infinitely divisible when someone asks you is space infinitely divisible then i would say yes it is and they might turn around and say how do you know and i would say general relativity\n- [35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2138s) how do i know that's true well i don't know that it's true however it is the best explanation that we presently have of space time and then they might get into a discussion about well if it's infinitely divisible then you're presented with xenos paradox all over again and i would say no you refute that by a simple experiment so we don't know how it is that we can travel through all of these infinite points if in fact there are infinite points xeno's paradox is about the domain of pure mathematics but we don't live in a\n- [36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2166s) world of pure mathematics we live in a world of physics and if the physics says that we can transverse an infinite number of points in a finite amount of time then that's what we'll do regardless of what the mathematics is every mathematical theory is held inside a physical substrate of a brain or a computer you're always bound by the laws of physics and these pure abstract domains may have no mapping to reality the overwhelming majority of theorems in mathematics are theorems that we cannot possibly prove\n- [36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2194s) this is girdle's theorem and it also comes out of turing's proof of what is and is not computable these things that are not computable vastly outnumber the things that are computable and what is computable depends entirely upon what computers we can make in this physical universe the computers that we can make must obey our laws of physics if the laws of physics were different then we'd be able to prove different sorts of mathematics and this is another part of the mathematician's misconception they think\n- [37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2225s) they can get outside of the laws of physics however their brain is just a physical computer their brain must obey the laws of physics if they existed in a universe with different laws of physics then they could prove different theorems but we exist in the universe that we're in and so we're bound by a whole bunch of things not least of which is the finite speed of light so there could be certain things out there in abstract space which we would be able to come to a more full understanding of if we could get outside of the\n- [37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2255s) restrictions of the laws of physics here happily none of those theorems that we cannot prove at the moment are inherently interesting some things can be inherently boring namely all of these theorems which we cannot possibly prove as true or false those theorems can't have any bearing in our physical universe they have nothing to do with our physical universe and this is why we say they're inherently uninteresting and there's a lot of inherently uninteresting things does probability actually exist in the\n- [38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2287s) physical universe or is it a function of our ignorance if i'm rolling a dice i don't know which way it's going to land so therefore i put in a probability but does that mean that there's an actual probabilistic unknowable thing in the universe is the universe flipping a coin somewhere or is it always deterministic all probability is actually subjective uncertainty and randomness are subjective if you don't know what the outcome's going to be so you roll a dice that's because you individually do not\n- [38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2316s) know it's not because there is uncertainty there deeply in the universe what we know about quantum theory is that all physically possible things occur this leads to the concept of the multiverse and rather than refute all of the failed ways of trying to understand quantum theory we're just going to take seriously what the equations of quantum theory say what we are compelled to think about quantum theory given the experiments is that every single possible thing that can happen does happen this means that there is no inherent\n- [39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2350s) uncertainty in the universe because everything that can happen actually will happen it's not like some things will happen and won't happen everything happens now you occupy a single universe and in that universe when you roll the dice it comes up a two but we know somewhere else in physical reality it comes up a one somewhere else three a four a five and a six if i'm rolling two dice then the universe in which they sum up to two is less than the number of universes in which we roll a seven because that can\n- [39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2377s) be three or four or five and a two and so on so the number of universes still does correspond to what we calculate as the probability yes this leads to what deutsch calls the decision theoretic way of understanding probability within quantum theory decision theoretic means you assume this proportionality between the universe is this way of splitting things up so if you're rolling two different dice then the universes proportion themselves into measures and what a measure is is it's a way of talking about infinities\n- [40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2410s) there is a video on youtube which has deutsche explained the famous quantum double slit experiment which is about particle wave duality is light a particle or a wave you pass it through a slit depending on whether there's observer and interference or not it ends up in a wave pattern ends up as individual photons and this is the famous experiment which has baffled people for a long time and caused them to revise their world view the one that led einstein to say god does not play dice with the universe correct einstein was a realist at the\n- [40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2439s) time when the founders of quantum theory were trying to develop a good explanation of what precisely was going on with these experiments in quantum theory einstein rejected all of them on the basis that they weren't realistic and he was right to do so because none of them made any sense and to this day none of the other alternatives make any sense now einstein didn't know about the multiverse we had to wait until hugh everett in the 1950s was able to devise a simple realistic way of understanding quantum theory but if i go back to this\n- [41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2471s) idea of the double state experiment it is often claimed that particles have a duality to them sometimes they're particles and sometimes they're waves the electron for example given certain experiments will behave like a particle and in other experiments it behaves like a wave people who hear this think well okay that kind of explains what's going on for example in the photoelectric effect you shine a light at electrons which literally means you're firing a photon a particle of light at an electron and you can knock the\n- [41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2500s) electron out of the atom this is supposed to be proof positive that light in the form of photons and electricity in the form of electrons are both particles because they're bouncing off one another and this is what particles do waves don't do that you watch water waves at the beach you'll see they pass through each other they don't bounce off one another waves will bounce off particles but they won't bounce off each other prior to young's twin slit experiment we actually relied upon newton's ideas of light and newton's\n- [42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2527s) idea was that light was corpuscular as he said which means made of particles and then young came along and he shone a light through two slits cut into a piece of paper and what you find when you project that light onto another sheet of paper is not just two beams of light you find what's called an interference pattern where the light has interfered with itself in the same way that when waves pass through small apertures natural geological gaps they will interfere with one another they produce crests in some places and\n- [42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2560s) troughs in others they can cancel each other out this was supposed to be proof to some of the early physicists that light in fact was a wave and now we get to quantum theory and we find that things we thought were certainly particles like electrons when we do the same experiment with them they interfere with one another so it appears as though we've got particles acting like waves and waves acting like particles the resolution to this is not to admit nonsense so this is what often is explained in quantum theory lectures\n- [43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2590s) in undergraduate level is that you have to accept that something like a photon is born as a particle it lives as a wave and then it dies again as a particle which is nonsense and the reason it's nonsense is because the photon doesn't know that it's alive and it's dead it doesn't know what experiment it's participating in so we have to come to a deeper understanding of how to explain what is going on in this double-slit experiment because if we fire either a photon or an electron at that double slit apparatus\n- [43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2620s) and we put a detector at either of those slits then we will detect a particle so we can detect that we fired a particle we can detect that a particle is going through those slits and we can detect a particle at the projection screen as well when you do this experiment in the laboratory using electrons you can see the dots where the electrons strike hitting the screen but you don't get a simple pattern that you would expect if you're firing cannon balls at a wall where there are two holes in the wall through which the cannonballs\n- [44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2649s) can go you would expect that all the cannonballs are going to go through those two holes and land in one of two positions behind the wall but with particles at the quantum level that's not what happens something is going on and the only explanation is that when we fire a photon there's the photon that we can see in our universe but there's also photons in other universes passing through the apparatus that we cannot see and these photons are able to interact with the photon that we are able to detect this is where\n- [44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2681s) the concept of interference comes in interference is an old concept in physics it goes back to waves waves certainly interfere but we need to understand the way in which particles can interfere one with another particles that we can observe and particles that we can only assume to observe given these experiments and this is why we are forced into acknowledging the existence of these other particles and not only these other particles but other universes in which these particles exist now people might object at this point\n- [45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2712s) and go how dare you invoke in science things that cannot be seen things that cannot be observed this is completely antagonistic towards the scientific method surely and i'll say to anyone who's thinking that right now almost everything of interest that you know about science is about the unobserved let's consider dinosaurs dinosaurs are unobserved you say oh hold on i've been to the museum i've seen a dinosaur now you have seen a fossil and a fossil isn't even a bone it's an ossified bone it has been metamorphised\n- [45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2743s) into rock so no one has ever seen a dinosaur we have seen things that look like dinosaurs and interpreted them to be huge reptilian bird-like creatures that when we assemble their skeletons we make up a story about what this thing was that walked the earth tens or hundreds of millions of years ago in the same way no one has ever seen the core of the sun and no one will ever observe the core of the sun but we know about stellar fusion we know that hydrogen nuclei are being crushed together there to form helium in the\n- [46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2776s) process producing heat we don't see the big bang we don't see the movement of continents almost everything of interest in science we do not observe even many of the things that we say we have seen we've actually just seen instruments detect those things so we're watching the effects through instruments and then theorizing that there are other universes out there where the photons are interacting with the photons that we can see there are many scientists philosophers have talked about this concept of a\n- [46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2801s) multiverse but this is a very strict very sober understanding of what a multiverse is all of these universes in this multiverse obey the same laws of physics we're not talking about universes where there are other laws of physics this should be no more surprising than historically when it used to be thought to be the universe consisted of our planet and around our planet orbited everything else other planets stars the sun the moon orbited around us existed on this tiny planet then our vision of reality got expanded\n- [47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2830s) a little bit we realized in fact we were not at the center of the universe the sun was at the center and these other planets were in fact bigger in some cases in the case of jupiter and saturn and the gas giants bigger than what our planet of earth is the sun was a lot bigger than what we are so our universe became larger then we realized that we were just one star system among many in a huge galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars then later we realized that this galaxy is one of hundreds of billions of galaxies so the history\n- [47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2858s) of ideas and the history of science is a history of us broadening our vision of exactly how large physical reality is and this is another step in that general trend and we should expect it to continue it shouldn't be that hard for people to accept that this is the way to understand things do we know everything about quantum theory and how this multiverse works no we haven't united this multiverse with general relativity we need a space time or a geometry of the multiverse which we don't have yet so getting back to good explanations\n- [48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2891s) where do these explanations come from there's currently an obsession with induction induction being the idea that you can predict the future from the past you can say i saw one then two then three then four then five so therefore next must be six seven eight nine there's a belief that this is how new knowledge is created this is how scientific theories are formed and this is how we can make good explanations about the universe what's wrong with induction and where does new knowledge come from you did mention the black swan\n- [48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2921s) earlier and i'd like to go back to that the black swan is an example that various people have used over the years in order to illustrate this idea that repeatedly observing the same phenomena over and again should not make you confident that it will continue in the future in europe we have white swan so any biologist who's interested in birds be observing white swan after white swan and apparently concluding on that basis that therefore all swans are white then someone travels to western australia and there you notice that\n- [49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2955s) there are swans that otherwise look identical to the ones in europe but they're black let's consider another example of induction ever since the beginning of your life you have observed that the sun has risen does this mean that scientifically you should conclude the sun will rise tomorrow and rise every day after that this is not what science is about science is not about cataloging a history of events that have occurred in the past and presuming they're going to occur again in the future science is an\n- [49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=2984s) explanatory framework it's an error correcting mechanism it's not ever of the form the sun always rose in the past therefore arise in the future there's all sorts of ways in which we can imagine the sun won't rise tomorrow all you need to do is to take a trip to antarctica and there for some months of the year the sun doesn't rise at all if you go to the international space station you won't see the sun rise once per day and set once per day it will rise and set repeatedly over the course of your very fast journey around\n- [50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3011s) the earth there's another example from science like this on a heat source put a beaker of water then put a thermometer into that water and turn on your heat source then record as the time passes what the temperature of the water is you will notice that the temperature of the water will increase you can do this with a saucepan at home so long as the heat source is relatively constant the temperature rise will be relatively constant as well so after one minute the temperature might go from 20 degrees celsius to 30 degrees celsius\n- [50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3043s) imagine every minute it climbs by another 10 degrees celsius but at some point it's going to stall when it hits the boiling point precisely now if you're a thoroughgoing inductivist or even a bayesian reasoner and you don't know anything about the boiling temperature and what phenomena happens at that temperature you can join all of those lovely lines into a perfectly diagonal straight line and extrapolate off into infinity after two hours according to your bayesian reasoning according to your induction\n- [51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3071s) we should assume that the temperature of that water will be a thousand degrees celsius but of course this is completely false what actually happens is once it starts boiling it stays at its boiling temperature we get a plateau and this plateau of temperature about 100 degrees celsius remains there until all the water boils away now there's no possible way of knowing this without first doing the experiment or having already guessed via some explanatory means what was going to happen no method of recording all of these data points\n- [51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3106s) and extrapolating off into the future could ever have given you the correct answer the correct answer can only come from creativity and notice that science is not about predicting where the trend starts and where the trend goes in fact if we want to explain what's going on with the water we refer to the particles and how as the temperature increases the kinetic energy of the particles starts to increase which means the velocity of the particle starts to increase eventually those particles in the liquid state achieve escape velocity\n- [52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3136s) from the rest of the liquid at this point we have boiling but that escape velocity the technical term is latent heat requires energy and for this reason we can have heating of something like water without any temperature increase that's what science is that whole complicated story about how the particles are moving faster this invocation of the term latent heat it's not about trends and predictions it's about explanation only once we have the explanation can we in fact make the prediction going even further it's not just science\n- [52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3166s) when we look at innovation and technology and building for example everything that thomas edison did and nikola tesla did these were from trial and error which is creative guesses and trying things out if you look at how evolution works through variation and then natural selection where it tries a lot of random mutations and it filters out the ones that didn't work so this seems to be a general model through which all complex systems improve themselves over time they make bold guesses and then they weed out the things that didn't work\n- [53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3196s) things like a beautiful symmetry to it across all knowledge creation it's ultimately an act of creativity we don't know where it comes from and it's not just a mechanical extrapolation of observations the most famous example on this we mentioned black swans we talked about boiling water but the fun and easy one is the turkey you could have a turkey that's being fed very well every single day and fattened up and it thinks that it belongs and lives in a benevolent household where the farmer comes and feeds it\n- [53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3222s) every day until thanksgiving arrives and then it's in for a very rude awakening or i should say an ending that shows you the limits of induction precisely the theories have to be guessed and all of our great scientists have always made noises similar to this it's only the philosophers or certain mathematicians who think that this is the way that science happens that it's this inductive trend seeking way of extrapolating from past observations into the future einstein said that he wasn't necessarily\n- [54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3251s) brighter than most other people it's that he was passionately interested in particular problems and he had a curiosity and an imagination imagination was key for him he needed to imagine what could possibly explain these things he wasn't looking at past phenomena in order to come up with general relativity he was seeking to explain certain problems that existed in physics induction wasn't a part of it good explanations rely on creativity these good explanations testable and falsifiable of course but they are hard to vary\n- [54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3282s) and they make risky and narrow predictions that's a good guiding point for anybody who is listening to this podcast and trying to figure out how they can incorporate this in their everyday life your best theories are going to be creative guesses not simple extrapolations i had a bunch of asides that i wanted to dive into like finding path integrals because it seems to me that there's some kind of a deep symmetry between multiverse theory and finding path integrals you're absolutely right he believed in\n- [55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3307s) multiple histories but to the extent that he thought that these were actually physically real things or merely mathematical objects is open to question he was relatively silent on the matter he was certainly a realist but he made one of the worst quips and's an absolute genius probably next to einstein second greatest physicists of the 20th century but he said if you think you understand quantum theory you don't understand quantum theory which is nonsense whoever it understood quantum theory david deutsch understands\n- [55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3336s) quantum theory so that was one of the few occasions where feynman fell into irrationality and pessimism i think was a plank who said science advances one funeral at a time yeah unfortunately even the best gets stuck behind i see this in my own field where you have some of the greatest investors of our time like warren buffett and charlie munger who are just absolute geniuses but they cannot wrap their minds around cryptocurrencies the idea that there's going to be an extra sovereign money that is native to the internet is\n- [56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3364s) programmable as foreign to them because to them money is always something that has been provided by the government and controlled by the government and they just cannot imagine it any other way so it's just the nature of people there's also the theory of solomon of induction i'm going to mangle the description but it says if you want to find a theory that explains why something is happening and now a theory here is something that's encoded as a binary string then the correct theory is actually\n- [56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3389s) going to be a probability weighted theory that takes into account all the possible theories but weighs them based on their complexity so the simpler ones are more likely to be true and the more complex ones are less likely to be true and you sum them all together and that's how you figure out the correct probability distribution function for your explanation that's similar to bayesianism isn't it in both cases they're assuming that you can enumerate all the possible theories but you can't because that's\n- [56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3415s) the creativity coming in it's very rare in science to have more than one viable theory in physics we mentioned newtonian theory of gravity and there was general relativity that's one of the rare occasions where you actually have these two competing theories it's almost unknown to have three competing theories what confuses people is that induction and bayesianism work really well for finite constrained spaces that are already known they're not good for new explanations bayesianism is i got new information i used to wait\n- [57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3444s) the previous probability predictions that i had now i've changed my probability based on the new data so i believe that something different is going to happen for example i don't know if you remember the monty hall show monty hall calls you up and there's three doors and there's treasure behind one of them and then two of them don't have anything and you pick which door it's going to be door number one two or three then he opens one of the other two doors and shows you there's nothing behind it\n- [57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3468s) now do you want to change your vote the understanding of knife probability says no i wouldn't change my vote why should it matter that one of the ones he showed me doesn't have something the probability should not have changed but bayesianism says you've got new information you should revise your guess and you should switch the other door and the easier way to say that is imagine there were 100 doors and then you picked one at random then he opens 98 of the remaining 99 shows you there's nothing now do you switch\n- [58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3494s) and of course you'd want to switch because what are the odds that you picked one of the 100 in the first place now your odds are 99 out of 100. and people discover this and say of course now i'm a smart bayesian i can update my priors based on new information that's what smart people do and therefore i'm a bayesian but it in no way helps you discover new knowledge or new explanations that's the uncontroversial use of bayesianism which is a very powerful tool it's used in medicine of trying to figure out which\n- [58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3521s) of these medicines might be more effective than others so there are whole areas of mathematics like bayesianism which can be applied in science without controversy at all it's where we say that bayesianism is the way in which we can generate new explanations or the way in which we can judge one explanation against another in fact the way in which we generate new explanations is creativity in the way in which we judge one explanation against another is either experimental refutation or straightforward criticism of realizing\n- [59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3550s) that one of those explanations is just a bad explanation induction also says that prediction is the main reason for the existence of science but it's not it's explanation you want an explanation of what's going on even if you can't necessarily predict with any certainty what's going to happen next in fact knowing what's going to happen next with some degree of certainty can be deflating and the unknown can be far more fun than having absolute certitude about what tomorrow will bring this brings us to the related point the\n- [59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3575s) science has never settled we should always be free to have new creativity a new conjecture you never know where the best ideas are going to come from and you have to take everything that's made in good faith seriously and so this idea that the science is settled or the science is closed is nonsense and it implies that we can all agree upon the process with which we come up with new theories rather through creativity and conjecture and the door is always open for new people with new ideas to come in and do\n- [1:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3600s) that as popper said we're all equal in our infinite ignorance so even if someone claims expertise they might even be valid in their claim to expertise there's an infinite number of things they do not know and those infinite number of things they do not know could affect the things they do know so the child who is coming through school who is not expert in anything can still come up with an idea that can challenge the foundations of the greatest expert because the expert like the child is ignorant about a whole\n- [1:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3628s) bunch of things they could have error that does not preclude someone else who lacks that fine-tuned knowledge from being able to point out there's an error and here's a better idea a lot of the theories as to why we're imminently going to create an agi are based on a naive extrapolation of computational power it's almost we'll do the induction of more and more computational power and ai has already gotten good at vision and beating us at chess and at video games so therefore it's going to start thinking soon another\n- [1:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3656s) offshoot that i want to discuss is this idea that humans are this resource consumers on the earth and we're eating up all the earth's resources so having more humans on the earth is a bad idea whereas if you believe that knowledge comes from creativity then any child born tomorrow could be the next einstein or the next findman and discover something that will change the world forever with creativity that has non-linear outputs and effects but at the moment we're very concerned about the pollution or the loss of\n- [1:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3683s) certain species and these are legitimate concerns for some people but it should never be at the expense of the long-term vision that perhaps we can solve all of those problems and far more if only we could have progress at a faster rate by using the resources that we have available to us there's in question why the world always seems to be full of more pessimistic than optimists especially when we still live with mostly enlightenment your values and such tremendous innovation there are probably multiple reasons for\n- [1:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3708s) that but it's just easier to be a pessimist than an optimist it's harder to guess how life is going to improve it's easier to linearly extrapolate how it's going to get worse you could also argue that the risk of ruin is so large that you can't come back from it that maybe we're hardwired to be pessimists because if you're correct when you're optimistic then you have a small gain but if you're wrong when you're optimistic and you get eaten by a tiger it goes to zero so maybe we're hardwired\n- [1:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3732s) to be pessimistic in that sense if you're an academic of some kind then being able to explain all of the problems that are out there and how dangerous these problems are and why you need funding in order to look at these problems in more depth that appears to be the intellectually serious position someone who claims that we can solve this it sounds a little bit kumbaya even though it's quite right that in fact collaboration cooperation and resource exploitation will actually be the thing that's going to drive this\n- [1:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3760s) the knowledge economy forward so that we can solve with these problems it always seems more intellectually serious if you can stand up there with a frown on your face in front of a ted talk audience and say these are all the ways in which we're going to fail and which we're going to come to ruin i'm guilty of having recorded one of these doomsayer podcasts about enders blowing up the earth that was the one podcast that i regretted the most we had a great conversation but i don't fundamentally agree with any of\n- [1:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3783s) the conclusions that might come out of that which say the world is going to end so we should slow down the only way out is through progress and subsequently i haven't promoted as much as i promoted my other podcast and upon reading deutsche i realized why it's because it's easy to be a pessimist it's an easy trap to fall into but it implies that humans are not creative it doesn't acknowledge all the ways that we have innovated our way out of previous traps and fundamentally entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic\n- [1:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3808s) because they get rewarded for being optimistic as you're saying intellectuals get rewarded for being pessimistic so there is always a lot of incentive bias here as an academic you may be incented to be pessimistic as an entrepreneur you may be incented to be optimistic if you're a pessimist you get your feedback from other people it's a social act you're convincing other people of your pessimism and so far most of their pessimistic predictions have turned out to be false if you look at any timelines on which\n- [1:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3836s) the world was supposed to end or environmental catastrophes were supposed to happen they've been quite wrong but if you look at the optimistic entrepreneurs they are rated by feedback from nature and free markets which i believe are much more realistic feedback mechanisms in general professions in which you get your feedback from other members of that profession tend to get corrupted when you see a journalist writing articles to impress other journalists or a restauranteur running a restaurant that's designed to\n- [1:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3864s) impress other foodies and other restaurateurs those end up not being practical and high quality they may receive accolades and prizes within certain elite circles but they're not reflecting reality where someone who is getting feedback from either mother nature like a scientist or an experimentalist or from free markets where other people are voting with their money and their time those are going to be much better predictors the people who are operating in the real world and are getting paid for it tend to be\n- [1:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3890s) optimist the people who are operating ivory towers are incented to be pessimists to be an entrepreneur you need to be optimistic about the fact that you're creating something that other people are going to find value in and people who have a pessimistic philosophy tend to have a pessimistic psychology as well if you're constantly thinking about all the ways in which the world is going to rack and ruin then this has a day-to-day impact upon your outlook on the rest of society and on your family on your friends\n- [1:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3918s) on everything because you think that this world is condemned so you're going to feel that weight upon your shoulders and it's going to come through in the way in which you present yourself to the rest of the world we see a lot of this on social media right now entrepreneurs are typically too busy to spend a whole lot of time on social media but you do get scientists academic journalists who are depressed with life because they have a pessimistic view of reality and that's got to have an impact upon their subjective experience of the\n- [1:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmJIA0pEf0&amp;t=3948s) world unlike people who are creating trying to bring something new into existence unfortunately the pessimism is self-fulfilling all evils are due to lack of knowledge rational optimism is the way out the data supports it history supports it and we can always come up with good explanations through creativity to improve our lives and everybody else's lives so stay optimisticThe message you submitted was too long, please reload the conversation and submit something shorter.Hello!

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "can you please summarize this transcript into 500 words and make bullets of the key points \n\nWelcome, everyone. It's day number eight of our yoga business mastery course. Great to have all of you here today. We will be chatting about time management, and this is a really, really important topic whenever you try to do anything new. But it's particularly important for yoga teachers because yoga teaching takes up a whole bunch of your energy. It's something that people don't talk enough about. But teaching just one class, especially if you're doing something that's new, can drain you for half the day. Teaching two classes, three classes, you can be completely done. So a lot of teachers that I meet, one of the struggles, even when they come up with new ideas, good ideas, growth plans, is trying to figure out how do I take the next step and where do I find the time? And especially for those of you who are juggling other things, whether it's another job or kids or family, other work obligations, it can be really difficult. Obviously, we all struggle with time, but I think because yoga well, I know because yoga teachers, that physical drain that it has on you, sometimes it can be really difficult to find the time. That's what we will be covering today. Let me give you a visual here, and we will jump right in here is going to be our focus for today. It's just to think about time as a default currency. What I mean by that is we often think about money or the US dollar or the yuan or whatever you might be thinking about. But really it's just time, right? We all have a limited number of time in the day, a limited number of years in our career, and a limited number of years on the planet. What are we going to do at that time? How are we going to make the most of it? So every consideration that you make about money is really a consideration for time. You've probably heard people say that you should stop trading dollars for hours. I'm not sure if you've ever heard that before, but the reality is we all do that. We all trade dollars for hours. That's how it works. Now, your hourly rate might be very high or it might be very low, but this is why they call it work. You give your time and you get something in return. And so no matter what we're doing, we want to be efficient and we want to try to figure out how to build something new. As we've talked about a number of times, one of the challenges in the yoga industry is because it's very free form. And what I mean by that is you'll get very little guidance from your peers, from your employers, from studio managers in terms of what steps are next. The only way that those next steps will happen is if you turn off Netflix, isolate, sit yourself down at a desk and start to get to work at putting these pieces together and that can be really challenging. And this isn't unique to you, it isn't unique to yoga. It's just a thing that all of us struggle with. Let's take a look our agenda today. First, we'll chat about feeding the dragon. And this is an analogy that I use which I find very, very helpful. We'll talk about different tools, software tools, and little tricks that can be helpful for your time. This is a really important one. Time vultures. Things that can really suck your time and suck your energy away. Chat about how to have a dopamine purge and how to buy back your time. And then some tips and missteps that might happen along the way. Before we do that, it would be really interesting for me and probably for all of you just down below in the chat, just share what's your biggest challenge with time management right now? And for some of you, it'll be, I have a kid and they're two and three years old. That's real, right? For some of you, your biggest challenge is maybe following a calendar. Maybe you really struggle with that. For some of you, maybe you're working two jobs. For some of you, maybe you struggle to work on your own. When you think about, like, time management, when you think about your week, we're here on Monday. What is the thing that comes up for you in terms of the thing that makes you struggle the most? And it could be anything. Maybe you don't have a good filing system. Maybe you're working from home and your partner is also working from home and you're both kind of still haven't figured out how to make all of that work. Maybe you run out of energy, maybe you get distracted by social media, whatever it might be. Dropping down the chat. I'd love to hear what kinds of things you personally struggle with. And we'll learn from each other as we go. Okay, feed the dragon. This is an analogy. Your dragon is your business. And the reason I use the analogy of a dragon is because dragons are huge and they're always hungry and they always need to be fed. Why? Well, there's so much bigger than us, right? We get hungry a few times a day. Dragons are always hungry. If you start to think of your business like a dragon, and I like to think about it like these sort of friendly dragons that you ride around the sky and you think about the dragon being you, your knowledge, your skills, your experience, and then your community, the people who know, like and trust you, that's your dragon. The dragon needs to be fed every day, all the time. And when you internalize that, it helps you to embrace the journey from yoga teacher to yoga business person, whatever that means for you. And so when you make this transition, the idea is, this is important, this is my job, this is my purpose. And if I don't feed the dragon, what will happen is the dragon will fly away. It'll go somewhere else. And so the reason this is important to keep in mind is because on a daily basis, there's a lot of stuff that needs to have happen. It's really, really common that you start to get frustrated and overwhelmed and discouraged, and you feel like, this isn't what I signed up for. But when you start to come back to, what are the bricks and mortar of a yoga business? It's me, my skills, my knowledge, my experience. It's my community. The people who know, like and trust me. So if I'm doing work on those two things, one, two of them, both of them, all of them, I'm feeding a dragon. If I'm feeding the dragon, my dragon will stay happy. It'll fly me around, and I can live my life. If I don't feed the dragon, it will fly away. What does that mean in real life? In real life, it means for you, it means studying something every day. It means doing a yoga practice every day. It means learning and growing. It means gaining more experience. It means constantly investing in your new asset deliberately and in a very crafted way on a regular basis, always reading something new, always learning something new. Maybe you're in a course, maybe reading a book. Maybe you're watching YouTube videos. Maybe you're practicing a new studio. Maybe you're learning something from another modality that you can pull into your classes, but always feeding you that asset. And in your community, this is the one where a lot of people slack off, and they haven't answered my emails in ten days. It's a bad idea. Or, I never answer my direct messages. People just ask me stupid questions. That's a really bad idea. Remember your community. That's an asset. You that's an asset. Really, really important to focus on that. We had a really good teacher here in the studio, but she misunderstood some of these concepts about a yoga business. And we had a student who wrote a really negative review on Google, places like Google Maps or whatever, and the student said, I went to the door of the studio to ask a question, and the teacher hid behind the desk. I was like, there's no way that happened. There's no way the teacher would hide behind the desk. And then someone on my team says, we better check, because they know it's a public review. It's a one star review on Google. It looks terrible, so we better check. So we have these security cameras, and we check, and sure enough, the student comes, knocks on the door, and the teacher hides behind the desk, and she has her phone, and she's hanging out behind the desk on her phone. And listen, we've all done things like that before. We've all done things like that before. And probably what she was thinking is, she's going to be another person asking me what power yoga means. She's going to be another person asking me what time classes. It's all on the website. These students drive me crazy. And is there a truth to that? Yeah, of course there's truth to that. But I'm sharing this story with you because it's kind of extreme. But I'm sharing this story with you because it's a very common trap to fall into where you go. It's all pointless. I'm just going to ignore it. But remember, if it falls into those two buckets, you and your community, that's the dragon, and that's a hungry dragon. You feed the dragon. Keep feeding the dragon, your business will continue to grow. You'll continue to create positive momentum. You'll continue to attract students to you. The moment you stop feeding the dragon, either you or your community, things start to get stale. They start to get stagnant. They dry up. The majority of the teachers who I grew up practicing with as a yoga student, they're no longer feeding their dragon. They don't really communicate with me or other students. They don't really do a lot of new learning or growth themselves. And their classes, which I see through occasional photos that they might publish on social media, are getting smaller and smaller and smaller. This is a shame. This is a waste. These are excellent teachers, but they're not feeding their dragon. Now, the teachers, on the other hand, who understand this concept of you, your community, it's a dragon. Part of my time management means when somebody knocks, I get up and I answer the same question again and again until they don't have questions. I'll keep answering it, right? Until I've learned everything. I'm going to keep studying. I'm going to keep buying books. I'm going to keep watching YouTube videos. I'm going to keep educating myself. And where will I get the motivation? It's the exact same thing. My knee hurts. Okay, I don't know that much about knees. You see this positive feedback loop. You learn what you need to learn based on the questions from your community, and the whole thing really becomes a positive snowball. It sounds really simple, and I know that a lot of you are saying, I would never hide behind the desk and plan my phone and ignore a customer. You might. I don't think any of us are above it. But the only way you would do that is if you lose perspective. This teacher who I'm speaking up, she's actually a really good teacher. She has a ton of potential, but she's missing this element. She doesn't understand this element. And if you don't get this, it can really take you sideways. This is part of my job, answering the knock on the door, which often these days shows up as a text message, a DM, a comment underneath the photo, all of these things. It's part of your job. Just an hour ago, I sat down in the middle of the floor back there in some awkward stretch, and I answered about 45 messages. Were some of them redundant? Sure. Were some of them boring? Yeah, kind of. But you know what? That's my job, right? It's my job to feed the dragon. And that particular dragon was community. Some of these students were new. Some of them were students I haven't spoken to in a couple of years. But they have questions, and what they're saying to me is, hey, you're a teacher, and I value your opinion. Can you help me out? What kind of teacher would I be if I ignored that message? What kind of teacher would I be if I ignored and just rolled my eyes and said, oh, why don't they just go read the articles on my website? I'll tell you, what kind of teacher would I be? A really boring teacher and not a very good teacher and a soon to be irrelevant feature. So you've got to feed the drag. And when you embrace this, it stops becoming such a constant decision making process, and you just understand knocking the door. Message a comment, a question. This is my business. This is what I'm building. What kind of tools can you use for your time? It's really important you have some kind of calendar system, and I think probably all of you do have some kind of calendar system. What might that be? It doesn't really matter, but maybe it's GCal, like Google Calendar. Maybe you use ical, maybe whatever calendar you use. But make sure you have a calendar system, and you need to live by your calendar. The more you teach, the more your calendar will really be crucial. Inevitably, we end up with really irregular schedules. As yoga teachers, even when we do our best to stabilize, there's still a random discovery call here a random private class, there a random workshop at the end of the month, and the vast majority of yoga teachers I know don't really have themselves organized. I don't care which calendar system you use, but I really encourage you to use something digital and make sure it works. Cross device. So if you're using GCal or ical or whatever it is, make sure you're using it on your phone and your computer, and make sure you live from there. Other things that can make your life really easy not really easy, but easier are alarms. So especially if you start to get your regular schedules, which many of you will like. Maybe you have a 10:30 a.m. Morning class on Mondays and Wednesdays, and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays you teach in the evening at 07:00 p.m. At a CrossFit box or something like this. When you wake up in the morning, you open up your Google Calendar, you open up your ical, whatever you're using, and you go in and you set timers. So if you need to leave the house an hour before your class starts, you set a timer, just like an alarm. If you have a phone call set up with a prospective employer or a prospective student and it's at 530 in the afternoon, you set a timer for 525. So you have five minutes to set up and make sure that you have your headphones in or whatever you need to do. A calendar and a timer can make a really big difference. Every yoga teacher I know who starts teaching quite a lot, their calendar becomes both absolute essential and also a source of anxiety because they're checking it constantly. Am I missing a class? Am I missing a class? What's here, what's there? Making sure time zones are synced up. So go digital, make a choice and just commit to it. Even if your calendar is pretty open right now, start to schedule in simple things like your practice, maybe some reading time, maybe some studying time, just so you start to get in the habit of it. I know some of you already have this habit for many, many years, but make sure you start to apply it to your yoga life as well. Another thing that's really important is to start using some templates. You will get a lot of questions that are the same and what templates mean is in Gmail, and I know most of you use Gmail, but it's also in other email servers. If you would like, there are templates that you can use in Gmail. They're called canned responses. I'll drop it here, I'll drop it here in the chat. It's called canned responses. And I'll send you a link, a HowTo video, how to set it up later on. But the reason canned responses are so helpful is because sometimes you're feeding your dragon and I'm going to be honest, you're going to get bored. And what do I mean by that? You go, oh no, somebody else is asking for the zoom link for the Tuesday class at 06:00 P.m. And you're typing hey there, blah blah blah. You go, It's fun. The first few times, yes, they're signing up. And then the 13th time you go, I don't want to do this. You put it off until the next day and the client's upset and they're worried this is a scam and they're freaking out. What can responses do? And in instagram they also exist. I think they're called instant replies. I'll send you a video on how to do that one too, is it allows you to answer similar questions the same way. And so what I mean by that is I have a bunch of these set up and so one of them is just my default zoom link. So I do a lot of just ad hoc zoom meetings with students and with colleagues and with other studios and things like this. And so I just have a little quick shortcut and it sends my zoom link right away because I probably send this three or four times a day and it's really annoying to go in and copy and paste and go through that whole routine. Now I know a lot of you are going out of some of you all do it, but really, even after you get like seven or eight emails of people asking, hey, how does this work? Or where do we go for the meeting point? Let's imagine you're doing outdoor class and you're doing like a yoga hike hike plus a yoga class, sunset and there's a meeting point, right? That sounds really simple, except you're going to need to send a Google Maps link where to meet. You're going to need to send time. You'll probably need to send your cell phone, your mobile phone number, these kinds of things. And so using Gmail canned responses, using instant replies in Instagram, you can very quickly and then you feed the dragon quickly and it's fine. If it feels laborious to answer emails, you'll stop doing it and that will be a mistake. There are other questions that you'll get a lot of. Maybe you have a class on, maybe you have some very unique classes, right? Maybe you're specialized in autoimmune conditions and you work with fibromyalgia and you get a lot of people who say, I don't know, maybe they have a specific type of pain question and it's always the same, well, you can write a really great email, put it in your canned responses, and then you're ready anytime anybody needs that. Maybe you create a thank you email that you sent to all your clients after class. Remember the other day we said with new students it can be great to send an email, we use a canned response. And how a canned response works is, let's say I have seven students in class today, two of them are new. After class canned response, I go into Gmail and I just pull down from a drop up down and says, great to have you in class. And I add in the person's name. So I say, Dear sir, great to have you in class today. I just wanted to let you know if you have any questions, I'm here hope to see you in class again soon. And if you have to type that out manually, you'll do this for like one or two classes, you'll never do it again. But when you have it in canned responses, you'll do it again and again and again. You'll be really consistent. These little things make feeding the dragon less of a hassle. It becomes just part of your work. And yes, a little bit of busy work, but there's a tremendous amount of busy work that you've learned to do in your life, from starting the dishwasher to taking out the garbage. And there's a whole bunch of things you don't really think about it anymore. And when you can create easier and easier ways for yourself to feed the dragon, you won't think about it. You just buzz to get things done. Okay, I will send you tutorials how to set up canned response because I'm guessing most of you don't have it set up in Gmail. And also tutorial how to set up instant replies in Instagram so you can do that later. This is another big one is meal and snack planning. People don't talk about this, but yoga teachers especially when you teach more than if you teach more than one class a day, the food thing is really a problem because you don't really like to eat right before class. And then after class, maybe you don't have a big enough break. Or it's a funny time, like four in the afternoon. And so planning your meals can really make your life a lot easier. And maybe that means you spend a Saturday afternoon or a Sunday afternoon doing some food prep. Maybe that means you figure it out in advance, but it really makes a big deal. And the way that you eat affects the way that you feel. And if you're hungry and you're having a great day but then you get starving and your blood sugar drops at 05:00 p.m., that's not going to work out very well. And so specifically for this type of job, obviously it's healthy food is important for everybody. But for this type of job where you get stuck in these blocks where you don't really have access to food and then you don't really feel like eating, meal planning is a big deal. We'll talk a little bit more about this later on. You really need to toggle between busy work and deep work. And what I mean by that is you need to get yourself in a routine of answering emails, answering messages, doing phone calls if you need to, sending messages and then doing deeper work. What we're doing now is deeper work. Thinking, strategizing, planning outreach to new studios, creating new opportunities, planning and preparing for new class formats, developing new workshops and things like that. You can't do deep work all of the time. In fact, most of us do mostly busy work. If you think about what you've done today, for example, most of us, even if we've had a really productive day, mostly we did a whole bunch of silliness, right? We cleaned the house and then we ran out and then we forgot the keys and then we did this and then we did that. Maybe we did about 30 minutes of work here. And if you get in two or 3 hours of real work in a day, that's actually pretty significant. I think this is the biggest discovery from the pandemic, from work, from home. People realize like, I wasn't actually doing that much work. It's kind of running around. And so when you're putting yourself, when you're creating a workflow for yourself, it's important to just embrace that there are different phases of the day and set aside time to do busy work. Set aside time to do deep work. And don't attempt to plan an entire workshop in one fell swoop in 6 hours straight. Schedule less and do more. And this is something that is absolutely a truism. If you have less things planned, you'll get more done than if you just kind of pack yourself in. And this especially has to do with classes. If you have a ton of classes on one day, like three classes, you're really going to have trouble getting much done. And so try to keep your scheduled events simple and blocks of time free so that you can plan to feed the dragon ongoing in a sensible way. And you do that by scheduling less and doing more. I'd like to chat a little bit about this. We chat about this on day number one. But part of time management is getting rid of time vultures. And the way that I like to think about this is if somebody from your past will not be part of your real life in the future, you have to respectfully unfollow them and let them live where they belong, which is in your memories. I'll share with you a story that really affected me. It's a very silly story, but it really, really affected me. A few years ago, I had someone get in touch with me on Facebook and she sent me a message and said, hey, Luke, we used to walk to school together in Minneapolis when we were five years old. So nice to find you here on Facebook. And I had this kind of existential crisis. I had 5000 friends on Facebook at the time. This person, I didn't recognize the name. Technically, I was born in Minneapolis, but I know Bangkok better than I know Minneapolis. I don't know anything about it. I certainly don't know this person. I'm looking at 5000 friends. I'm looking at this message and I'm thinking about stuff that I don't even remember. And I realize this has gone too far. This has gone too far. And technology is amazing, communication is amazing. But this person was part of my five year old experience walking to school. This is not relevant. This is not where I should be putting my time. I should be investing in the people in my current and my future life. I should be investing time in my current and my future job and projects. And the way that I phrase this is like the lost art of forgetting. Someday I'll do a lot more writing about this, but like in the old days, you just forget. You just forget people. And I don't mean that with any kind of malice or anything like that, but you would just forget people and you would forget things. And maybe you'd be at a class reunion and somebody said, hey, do you remember Jason from the soccer team, from the football team? He'd go, oh yeah, Jason, where is he now? And that'd be great, right? But you don't see Jason on your newsfeed every single day. And the birth of the kids and the marriage and the divorce and the trip to the Maldives, and this is too much. Jason is not part of your life anymore. And yet most of us are just overwhelmed with people from our past, whether they're positive, whether they're negative, whether they emotionally trigger us or not. But they're not part of our future. And I think for most of you, if you started to look at what you're paying attention to, there's a lot of ghosts from your past. And ghosts isn't even the right word. And in many cases, they're really positive memories and positive people. And yet if I said, hey, are you going to call them this month? That would be weird. Why is that weird? I don't know. It's been so long. Where do we start? And they live in another state. They live in another country. They're doing this thing well. Are you angry at them? No, of course I'm not angry. We have such great memories. So, I mean, are you planning like a re? No, I don't think we're ever going to see each other again. Okay. Unfollow block. Poof. They're gone. That includes cousins. That includes uncles and aunts. I don't mean this with any kind of malice, but if you don't plan to visit that second cousin or that first cousin who's doing weird stuff on Instagram, you got to get rid of them. You got to get rid of them because remember what we chatted about, your time is your greatest asset. If you're giving time to people who you openly and freely admit you have no plans to make plans with, that doesn't make any sense, right? It just doesn't make any sense. You're better off just knocking on your neighbors door and saying like, hey, how's it going? You're better off hanging out on Instagram and talking to your real life today students than you are somebody from your past. The hard thing is it feels like it's almost invalidating. It feels like those friendships or those experiences or that previous job colleague who you have so many great laughs with, who you now haven't seen in twelve years. It totally matters and it's totally irrelevant. And you got to let it go. It's a lost starter, forgetting. And when you do that, suddenly you'll have more space in your day to do things that are relevant to you right now. Time Vultures the biggest one, of course, is social media. For exactly the reason that I said for many of you right now, when you log into social media, you can see these people from your past, both ghosts and also very positive people from your past, who realistically will play zero role in your future. Were you to have a major life event, you would not notify them. Were you to do anything significant, they would not be part of that experience. They've got. To go. The other one that's really difficult, especially right now, is news. And it's really a delicate balance because we want to be informed, responsible citizens. We also want to help out and participate as an active member of society to some extent, some of you more than others. But it's really difficult when, like, right now, we're in the midst of just a very, very difficult news cycle, and news is coming at us, not just from creators of the news who are problematic in their own right, but it's coming at us from social media people. It's coming at us from high school students who are suddenly broadcasting battle scene updates and things. It's completely overwhelming. And again, while all of us want to be informed and educated and participate in democracy, I think as much as we can. And again, some of you very much so. Some of you not at all. We don't want to be kicked around for things that we have no control over. In the same way I have no control or influence over Jason's life, my high school buddy who's now living in a different country and married and struggling with the construction business. I also don't have control over things outside of my sphere of influence. I'm not saying put blinders on and ignore the world, but I'm saying you got to have some sort of filter, or you can get sucked down every single news cycle. And while I know it seems really intense right now, it's very unlikely this will ever stop. I don't mean this situation that we're in right now. I mean this amplification of the news, which has progressively happened over the past five years. After this crisis passes, let's hope soon there will be more, and they won't stop. And so you have to set some tools in place, or you can suddenly become a war correspondent when really you're meant to be a yoga teacher. And your yoga teaching work in your own little place, in your own community can have a really tremendous value. Whereas being kind of an amateur work correspondent, which many people are right now, is not adding value or helping. It's just proliferating anxiety. It's a really tough one. And again, I don't have the answer. And I know just even talking about that, I don't know what to do. How much do I learn? How much do I not learn? But the news is a rough draft of history. Giving yourself some space in the news cycle is helpful. Here's another really big one, is phone notifications. I was at lunch with a fellow yoga teacher recently, and we both had our phones on the table, as you do during lunch, and her phone just started going bonkers. I mean, just bonkers. And I was like, what's going on there? Is everything okay? Like, is there an emergency? It's like, no, it's just instagram. And I just saw her phone. I guess this is what people have every single notification, every single comment, every single heart of her morning photo of yoga or whatever was pinging her phone. You got to turn all that stuff off. That stuff will just make you crazy. Just make you absolutely crazy. And I know for some of you, you're like, yeah, I did that a long time ago, but I would say, really? Did you flip up your phone right now and take a look? You have notifications. Just turn them all off. Turn them all off. See what you can get away with. You might even be able to turn off notifications from friends and family, and you might be able to change a setting so that if they call you, that phone comes through. So, like, my kids and my partner and stuff, if they call, my phone makes a special sound, and they almost never call. And the reason that I do that is not because I'm some sort of maniacal control freak or anything like that, but because, again, I had that moment where I'm sitting at lunch and my phone was quieter but still not physically buzzing, but still was lighting up. Her phone was on fire, just on fire. And I thought, what does any of that have to do with your happiness, your mission, your clients, your business, your contentment? Zero. Nothing. It's just completely a time stock. But if you start to look at people's phones, including your own, you'll mostly see notifications happening like crazy. If you turn all of that stuff off, it can be a really great relief. And that's when people do different things. Like, they'll go they'll turn off. They'll go on airplane mode and turn everything off. If those things work for you, that's fine. I find that for most people, that's not really realistic, because maybe you end up researching things, maybe you end up emailing from your phone or whatever it is. But if you simply turn off those notifications, that can make a big difference. And then think about these in terms of time vultures, the other thing that I think is important to think about is zero value add people and zero value add events. And this sounds really ruthless, but at the same time, it's just honest. And what I mean by that is there are some people in your life who don't add any value to your life. That doesn't mean they're bad. That doesn't mean that they're stupid. That doesn't mean that you should be mean to them, but it means that they're not actively contributing to your growth. They're not actively sharing positive ideas. They're not people you turn to when you have a conflict. They're just there at different times of our life. We have a lot of zero value add people. When my middle son was younger, actually, when my first kid was the youngest, my daughter, she was the youngest, somehow I didn't really understand how to navigate parenting, and I'd end up at all you have these play dates, right, where the kids play, and suddenly I'm hanging out with tons and tons and tons of parents. And by hanging out, I mean just hanging out, talking about random stuff. These are really, really nice people who I don't have anything in common with. Really, really nice people who I don't have a past, a present, or a future with. Really, really nice people who are suddenly having barbecues and meet ups and gatherings, which really just are not for me. They're wonderful people, and we don't really get along. They're really great people who I do not turn to in a crisis. They're really great people who I do not share inspiring ideas with. And a lot of you have zero value add people, and in no way do I block these people from my life. In no way am I mean or cruel. But at the same time, you got to think about the people that got you to where you are. Probably not the same. We're going to take you to where you're going. And who are those people? Right now, little by little, can I opt out of those events, can I opt out of those social situations to create more space? Because, again, if we think about building a business, we're actually thinking about building time. When we think about building time, we're talking about creating more space to be able to do more creativity. So think about those zero value add people and zero value add events. Almost all of you have some of them, and for some of you, it also includes stuff with either relatives or in laws. And those can be really tricky. And again, in no way am I advocating, like, ruthlessly cutting people off, but just kind of carving off healthy boundaries and thinking about not sure that this is really serving me anymore. Not sure that I'm really excited about this anymore. Let me stop. And also some things that you can find very fulfilling will suddenly one day just become zero value add, meaning I am no longer growing. I am no longer learning. Let me switch. Let me pivot with all smiles and nothing but good feelings. Let me make a move. Dopamine purge. And this is something so we have these neurotransmitters. I'm sure you've heard of them. Different happy chemicals. There's four main happy chemicals, and dopamine is one of them. And dopamine is released very much in anticipation of and so they talk about dopamine a lot with, like, drug addiction. But the dopamine, the dopaminergic pathway is actually triggered more from the craving than from the actual drug use itself. And so this like, could I get a notification I just posted on Instagram? Did five people like it? Did ten people like it? Especially that randomized. It really triggers your dopaminergic pathways, which is why social media is so addicting. The randomness, the unpredictability. Anything could happen. What could possibly be on TikTok today that's what really, really triggers us. And so this isn't good or bad, but it's a thing. And right now there are more dopamine hits than ever before in human history. So much so that my 17 year old daughter, if left to her own devices, will literally plant herself on the couch and just swipe on TikTok, right? Take the phone and kick her out of the house. It's a thing. It's a problem. It's just as big a problem as somebody been to drinking or been smoking is a thing. And all of us get into this. So what can you do? Here are some of my suggestions is you need to really get in the habit of unsubscribing, unfollowing blocking people who are causing this weird feeling, this weird feeling. And so turning off notifications for sure does this. Actively unfollowing and blocking and unsubscribing from people are really important. For some reason, LinkedIn has turned into total garbage recently. I don't know why. It used to be really boring stuff like, here's what's happening in the health market. People in the industry would post like, some charts and things like this. It was really, really dull. Suddenly it's just become all the normal mimi stuff that you find all over the Internet. And I have been active, unfollowing people at the rate of like ten to 15 per day. And I do it with a smile on my face and nothing but love. But I just don't want to see this stuff. I want to stay focused on the things that matter to me, the things that matter to my clients, the things that are growth oriented, and a meme that says no pain, no gain. You can choose whatever you want in life and this kind of stuff, I don't need that anymore. So actively, actively blocking these things. We chat about Time Vultures and a lot of these are friends from our past, but the demons from your past are worse. And that's that boss who you hated but you still have a connection to on LinkedIn. And every time they post something, you secretly curse their name. That's your ex who you quietly stalk on Instagram late at night when you said you wouldn't. And now you are. Just block them. Once you block them, you will forget them. Blocking is such a wonderful feature and not enough people use it. Your block list should be like a mile long and growing every day. Every time you see some celebrity who you don't like coming on your newsfeed, just block them and poof. They will literally disappear. They will literally disappear. It's great on your phone. I'd really encourage you to take your social media apps and swipe them all the way to the last screen and then put them in a folder. It just makes it a little bit harder to get there. Obviously you can just do an app search and you'll very quickly learn how to do that, but somehow that little bit of extra friction can make a big difference. Some of you will even have more aggressive things where maybe you delete certain apps from your phone and you only use it on your computer. I don't have one right way to do this but if you're not curating your life you will just get sucked into this dopaminergic triggering thing that is your phone every step of the way you just won't get anything done. Never stop curating your inbounds and your inputs. So if you found that hey, you just got on TikTok for the first time and you thought it was all silly dancing and then suddenly like my daughter 8 hours later you're there. Think about appropriate use think about appropriate use what that means for you. Do you set a timer? Do you drag the app? Do you log out of the app? Do you change your password and have somebody else change your password so you can't get in? This is real. It's really a thing. It's a huge crazy problem and it's very difficult to get something done when there's just this quick hit of likes and engagement and ghosts from your past and all these things that can take your attention all over the place. I'm not a puritan. I don't believe that the past is the future. The future is social, the future is online, the future is connectivity but just like anything there's appropriate use, right? When I was a kid in the 80s I'd talk on the telephone to my friends, a wired telephone for like 3 hours my parents had to sit me down and say hey, that's too long, let's limit it to 15 minutes. It's appropriate use, it's appropriate use. It's the same with the television. It's the same with video games. It's just getting harder and harder to control appropriate use. But it's a conversation you need to be having with yourself all the time. If you intend to get anything done, if you intend to get anything done, you have to have these conversations because you just get sucked in. Not by any moral failing, not by any weakness, but because these things are designed to pull you in. This is a conversation that people don't have enough but this is about how to buy back your time and there are a number of different things you can do to quite literally get your time back and it's really really important. I lived in Southern California for quite a while. And I remember I was in Orange County, and there was I guess it was around, like, Mission Viejo. I can't remember if it was Mission Viejo or Laguna Negal, but every year there would be a big Christmas lights thing. Crazy lights, like like just multi millions dollar crazy homes. White lights. Spectacular, like just way over the top. And so I remember driving around this neighborhood this would have been like, I don't know, early 90s or something. Driving around this neighborhood to see the lights, right? See the lights on these crazy mansions. And I remember seeing these people washing their cars, and I remember looking at it, and I just think because I always had to wash the car. When I was a kid, my dad made me wash the car. I've watched the car like a million times, every part of the car. And I remember sitting there and I was like, this guy, this woman. They have this house which is worth, I don't know, 3 million, 5 million. That was back then. It's probably worth more now. It's all covered in lights. Here he is on a Friday night, and he's washing his car. I washed the car. He's washing the car. This guy is successful, what's he doing? And this is a trap that we follow into, where we forget. We forget that what we're looking for here is time. Because time is where you can do whatever you want. Maybe you want to learn more. Maybe you want to have children. Maybe you want to write a book. Maybe you want to go on vacation, sit on the beach. But the mistake that people make is that more is more is more. More notifications, more tasks, more and more. At some point, you have to stop and say, I need to get my time back. I need to buy my time back. So a couple of things. One thing that has been revealed during the pandemic is a lot of this work life balance research has kind of come to the forefront. And one of the top deciding factors about whether people like their job or not, in some studies, it's as high as number one is the fact that your work is less than ten minutes from your home. Work is less than ten minutes from your home. And so this is why a lot of people, despite the stress and the mental health and the rules and the scariness of all the COVID stuff, a lot of people are happier working from home. Is it that they really like to be huddled over a laptop? Is it that they really like to be working in their sweatpants? I don't know. Maybe some people. I think a lot of people miss getting dressed up and going to work, but, you know, they don't miss a 45 minutes commute. They don't miss sitting in traffic. This is something that we don't like. And so if you can figure out a way to do micro living, this can totally transform your life. Meaning if you can think about that statistic, if my work can be ten minutes or less from my home, that might be more important to me than how much I'm making. That might be more important to me than even what I'm doing. How can I arrange that? So what might that mean for some of you? It might mean moving out of the city, getting a less expensive home with a garage and teaching from there. For some of you, it might mean moving into the city so you can walk everywhere. For some of you, it might mean just thinking about not taking the job from the studio. That's all the way across town. I had a friend who started teaching a lot of private yoga, and she initially had her clients within. Her whole thing was like a ten minute or less taxi ride. She was living in Hong Kong, and that was her whole thing. And then little by little, she started taking out more clients. More clients, more clients. And then she's in a taxi for 45 minutes. She's in a taxi for an hour. And she just had to stop and stop taking the clients. And for her, she understood that less money was not less. It was not less. Less money was not less. Right? You have to optimize. At some point, you have to buy back your time. And sometimes buying back your time means earning less money, but having more space. Because if spending 45 minutes on the road to get to a studio is not worth it, you got to make that a priority. I used to work with this guy, a really successful, famous yoga teacher, and he lived and lives in Los Angeles. And Los Angeles is as many of you know, it is a city, technically, but it's kind of like this whole basin, right? And so he started working at this studio, and they were really excited about him, so they offered him a percent ownership of the studio. They just threw it at him. Hey, we'd love to have you teach here. Here's the deal. If you'll come teach here just once a week for the rest of your life, basically we'll give you a 10% ownership in the studio. Well, of course, the studio wasn't making any money. And of course, once a week, who cares? That's the greatest deal ever. He likes teaching, but the studio is an hour and a half in Los Angeles traffic, an hour and a half drive, right? And so I just want to give you an extreme example, because he ended up giving up 10% ownership in the studio because he didn't want to take the class. And it was the right decision. It was the right decision, right? You got to buy back your time. It's just not worth it. There are other things that a lot of people don't think about for buying back your time, which are very smart things to do, ordering your groceries online. I think almost everybody has been doing this since the pandemic, but it can make a massive difference. Your grocery list is remembered. You can get the same stuff. It makes your life a lot easier. Now, I know some of you like to go to the market. I also like to go grocery shopping, but I also like to have free time. You find the balance. Maybe you go every other week. Maybe you go every couple of days instead of every day, but trying to figure out how can I get back some time so I have more space for me. My practice, my studies, my learning, my growth. So I have more time to answer those emails and those questions coming in for my students and not feel like my whole personal life is falling apart. Food prep is a big one. Here's my routine. Which just sounds completely when I tell people that, wow, this is crazy. So on Sundays, my ten year old and I, and sometimes a three year old comes along to we go to the market and the market is, I don't know, about 20 steps from my house and we have a little wheelie cart. I call it the grandpa cart. And we go and we fill it up with, I don't know, pretty much I just buy every fruit and vegetable in the shop and then we take it home and have somebody who comes to help me. And it costs around €10 per hour. She loves to come and people need work and they're looking for work. I used to wash cars. I've done all these jobs. I used to mop floors, they used to clean bathrooms, they used to pour beer. People need jobs, right? People need jobs. So she comes on Sunday and what does she do? She washes and cleans everything. And within 3 hours, my entire refrigerator is filled with chopped vegetables and fruit for the entire week. And all of us eat better. We don't order out. We don't get any takeout food. We don't want it. It's really easy. It takes about three minutes to make a meal. Whether it's a salad or a stir fry or whatever, you might make it's all there. This kind of thing takes a little bit of planning, but this is about how you buy back your time. Now, the excuse that I always get from people is like, oh, that's so expensive. I'm like, it's definitely not expensive. Every single person I know eats out more than me. Every single person I know spends more money on food than me. Not because they're lazy, but just simply because they haven't thought about this as an option. You can buy back your time with things like food prep and laundry and it sounds totally crazy, but really it's not. Really, it's not. You need to think about if you're building, if you're growing, if you're tired, you can do this. And there are people all over the world who are really excited to have entry level jobs, thousands of them, at any given time, no matter where you are in the world. Things like laundry, things like house cleaning, really, these kind of entry level jobs, depending on where you are, it might be $10 an hour, it might be $15 an hour. Whatever it is, if you've got your work or your community work, maybe you even start with just a couple of hours a week. But this makes sense. What makes no sense is to have a $5 million house covered in Christmas lights, spending your time cleaning your car. It doesn't make sense. It just doesn't make sense. You should get a smaller house, have somebody wash your car and use that time to do whatever it is you do. Maybe he was a lawyer, maybe he's a golfer. I don't know what he's doing. But there has to be some type of benefit. And where this has to be going is not more right. Your life five years from now cannot be filled from morning to night with busy work and chores and all these kinds of things. At some point, what you're building has to free up more space for you. Instead of buying swag back, buy back your time. I don't own a car. I don't own any I ride an old rusty bike. But certain things you start to realize, wow, there's tremendous value in having this space. There's tremendous value in feeding my family well without stressing about cooking and cleaning these kinds of things. It's really these small little things which can make a massive difference. What does this really boil down to in terms of time? I don't know. If you save yourself 3 hours a week, you think it's not that big a deal. But little by little by little, 3 hours a week, it really stacks, right? That's 12 hours a month. That's almost a part time job. 12 hours a month of free time. If you just took half that, maybe you spend half that time just relaxing or reading a book or doing self care meditating, I don't know, whatever. You go into a yoga class. But maybe you spend half that time, 6 hours a month planning your next workshop, spending time crafting some type of event or training or retreat that will take you. If you spend 6 hours a month on that, that's a tremendous, tremendous windfall of time and energy. So I just want you to think that the goal here is even though so much of this is you're a one person show, you're a one man, one woman show, all that is true. At the same time, I want you to think about building a business also means creating opportunities for other people. And sometimes people forget about that. At any given time, there's a whole bunch of people who need entry level jobs and they'd be very happy to help you. And it's much easier to hire somebody to do simple service based stuff in your house than it is to hire somebody who costs a fortune to do something like marketing or accounting. And oftentimes you can neglect or even put those off for a very long time. But getting some basic, basic health can really transform your work life very quickly. In terms of time management, here's the thing that I just like to think about it. Why are you not coming to this barbecue? Why are you not showing up to this event? Why are you not chopping your own vegetables? And when it comes to your time, you don't have to explain. I'm not doing it because my time is mine. And every single year I'm getting older. Every single year, I get less of it. Every single year, I see more and more value in it. And I want to use my time. I don't need to explain. It's mine. It's my time. So I'm going to do whatever I want with it. Just like it's your money, you can do whatever you want with it. If you like to spend your money on organic food, do it. If you like to spend your money on fancy watches, do it. It's also your time. You get to decide. You don't have to explain. And you can't just make time. Unlike money, which you can make more of, you can't make more time. And so things like, hey, I can't make it. I won't be able to join you. I'll be cheering for you, but I can't go. Thanks for inviting me, but I can't. These are some of my default social event bailouts. And again, with no bad intentions, just let people know you've got to do something else. I'll share with you some real examples because I'm a student of this too. I'm always learning and trying to get better, and I'm as guilty of getting sucked down these dopamine tunnels as anybody else. For my podcast, I interview a lot of authors, and writing a book is very, very hard. It takes a lot of time. And I'm always amazed by how often I get a response of no from authors and their excuse is just great. And they'll often say, Lucas, I'd love to come on your show. I can't do anything until July. I'm writing a book. Get back with me then. I just I always respect that answer so much because what they're saying is, I need to do deep work. I want to do PR, I can't do PR and I got to work. And for whatever reason, I have seen these lines drawn in the sand best by authors. I think it's because it's just so hard to sit down and write 60,000 words. So I've really tried to learn from their example of just with all the best cordial response in the world, just saying, hey, I can't come. I'm working on this. I got something else going on. Love to be there. Support you from afar. Send me some photos. But make time for yourself because nobody else can do it for you. Nobody else can create this time for you. You really have to set it aside for yourself. Okay, so some tips. Phone, computer notifications, turn them off. You're definitely not making noise and definitely not at night. No inbound calls. And when I tell people this, they think this. Is completely crazy too, but I don't answer my phone. If my kids call me, I answer the phone. But even I discourage them from calling me also. They send me messages and then I'll call them back. And I do that because I'm in classes a lot like this. But once you set up this situation, it becomes really conducive to work. It also becomes conducive to better conversations. So when I do call my kids, I am present. When I do call my parents or my brothers, I'm present. And I can be there. I'm not in the middle of the day rushing between places, and I know some people sort of like that spontaneity of communication. But sometimes to create deeper experiences, whether it's a telephone call or a deeper work, you just have to block inbound calls. Surprisingly, you can get away with this. I take almost no inbound calls whatsoever, and I make almost no calls too, which is surprisingly. You can get away with your desk in your workspace free of clutter. In many ways, we're so affected by our environment, and this is a constant, constant battle. I clean my desk two times a day, in the morning and at night, and I aim to have absolutely nothing on it. Right now I have some of these goofy anatomical parts, but usually I have absolutely at the end of the day, I have absolutely nothing. And every day I force myself to get rid of it. Right now, I have no drawers, because if you have drawers, they get filled with papers. They get filled with junk. Just getting rid of things. Getting rid of things. Keeping your workspace clear so your mind can be clear, that has to do with your computer desktop as well. A lot of people, you look at their computer desktop and you go, it's like one of these crazy closets where you open up and the hats and shoes are falling out. It makes a difference. It makes a difference. It's low grade stress, anxiety, and you just feel like there's stuff everywhere. Take some time to dump stuff. If you don't know what to do with it, throw it all in a box and hide the box. If you don't know what to do with the stuff on your computer, throw it all in a folder, drag it to an external drive, upload it to Google Drive, and just forget about it for a while. If you don't use it for a year, forget about it forever. Really makes a big, big difference. This last one is a really big one. And I know some of you are guilty of this. You got to do real work on a computer or a laptop, not on your phone. See, a lot, a lot of yoga teachers trying to run their whole world from your phone. You will never be productive. You will never like communicating. You will never get anything done. If you're just working on your phone. You can do a lot on your phone, but you can't do work. Work. You can't effectively email five studios in a day using your phone. You can't effectively respond to people on your phone. You really need a laptop, you need a keyboard, you need a larger screen. It's really, really important. Meet a lot of teachers who are trying to run their whole business from their phone or from an iPad. Don't do it. Don't do it. It also helps you to kind of segment your time. So work time is on a computer, and maybe your phone is for fun time or relaxing or these kinds of things. But if you're answering more than a couple of emails or a couple of messages on your phone every day, you just won't be efficient. And if you're not efficient, you're not making use of your time. If you're not making use of your time, what are we doing here anyway, right? So you really have to be strict about this for yourself. Some common missteps it's funny because some of the missteps are the common ways that we free up time as well, too. But one of the most common things is that yoga teachers, because a lot of them are running their business from their phone, because a lot of them have not cleaned up their notifications. Meaning, when they get an email, it bings. When they get a heart on their Instagram post, it dings. When Google News sends an update, it dings. And there's a new podcast, it dings. So they don't answer their emails. I've worked with yoga teachers who answer emails about every five weeks. This is a disaster. What happens is you just don't get paid. You don't get jobs, you get overlooked, you get missed. Nobody wants to work with you. It's really important, especially for business emails, like with studios and potential jobs and people inquiring about events, it's really important that you answer messages. It's one of the very simplest ways to stand out. I'll never forget it was one of the early courses that I was doing is probably about, I don't know, twelve years ago in Thailand. We had a group in Thailand for a month for a training course. And we were going around and we were saying, hey, why did you choose this course? Why were you here? And people would say, like, I just always wanted to come to Thailand, or I've been watching your YouTube videos and I remember one student stand up and they said, Lucas, I have to be honest, the reason I came of this training is because I emailed you. And about 2 hours later you emailed me back. And he said, that day I emailed about five different teacher training programs and none of them ever emailed me back. And you emailed me 2 hours. And I'm sitting there thinking like, I put together this course, it's a month long, I got the food, I got the blue. I got all this and the only reason you came is because I answered your email. And then I just had to swallow humble pie and I realized was like, okay, if that's what I've got, that's what I've got. And so, of course, I've done so many other things that I want to be appreciated for. At the end of the day, what this guy is saying is, hey Lucas, your course is okay. But what I really like is you answer the emails. And I realize this is another way. Another way that you can stand out from the industry is just be professional, be responsive and answer people, because almost nobody's doing it very, very common that you'll email people and you will never, ever hear from them ever again. Poor follow up is another problem when working with a lot of yoga teachers, they'll send messages from their phone. It even says sent from iPhone. They don't even bother to turn that off. And they'll be all in lower case or all in caps, no punctuation, this kind of stuff. Unprofessional communication really just a bad idea. Just a bad idea. This is another misstep that can happen, is listening to feedback from non customers. And what I mean by that is if somebody we've mentioned this a couple of times. When people pay, they pay attention. You as a provider should also only pay attention to people who give you feedback. What I mean by that is the majority of the negative feedback trolling critique, name calling that comes my way is from people who've never done business with me. They're just some random person who saw me wearing a mask on Facebook and suddenly think I'm a member of the who knows what party or something like this. And literally this kind of thing happens. And then the other way too, they call you crazy names and all kinds of crazy stuff. And so it's really important that if you get feedback, you pay attention to who that feedback is coming from. It's coming if it's coming from a colleague, pay attention. If it's coming from one of your students who comes to every class, pay attention. If it's coming from a new student who just took class for 15 minutes and then walked out and they said, hey, the temperature or wasn't right, keep in mind that you got to focus on the things that matter. Another problem with time management is just failure to fire clients that are a time vulture. This is really important and it goes hand in hand with stepping over dollars for dimes. A lot of times teachers will work too hard for things that are just not important enough and they won't spend time on the things that are important. Firing problematic clients is a really important part of this industry that you have to get comfortable with. We have to get a client who will just be terrible. I'll give you an example. We had a trainee. This is very recently, about three months ago, and she didn't pass her exam. When people don't pass the exams, we always support them. We give them multiple opportunities. We send them specific feedback, saying, here's what you need to do, and we're here for you, and can we try again in a week? And this kind of thing. And occasionally people get really triggered by it, and they've never I don't know the story. People have different experiences. Any case, this woman went crazy, called me names, told me she was a medical doctor, told me I was stupid, just a stupid yoga teacher. I mean, blah, blah, crazy, crazy. So I tried a couple of times. I'm so sorry. We want to get you through. Let's try again. I do need to let you know you can't talk to me or my staff like that, but it's okay. It happened once. Let's not do it again. Then she sends back, you're an idiot. I bank $1,000. Okay, refunded her and sent her away. That's it. She continues to send messages. We just block her. You have to be willing to do that, because you will get crazy people in the studios. It also happens where you get people who are not well. We've had many times people who come to every class, like, three classes a day. We had one woman came to five classes a day. You have to say, like, here's your money back. I'm so sorry. You got to go. And with all the love and all the compassion, you'll get crazies, and they will completely drain you. I'm a member of different yoga groups and things, social network groups, like on LinkedIn and stuff. And it's one of the more common things. As people are posting about Vulture clients, they're like, what do I do? This person shows up 30 minutes before class. They stay an hour after class. Everyone's uncomfortable. They're asking weird questions. They never go away. They take three classes a day. You have to be willing to just say, like, with all the good intentions, it has been great to have in class. I'm so sorry. We have to part ways. It's really important. You can have one student who can suck up the energy that you could potentially share with ten, and it's just not working. And it's a very real thing in this industry that you need to be comfortable with. Okay, homework, tools. Review your toolkit. What are you using? What are you using for calendar? What are you using for timers? What's going to happen tomorrow morning when you wake up? Do you have a system? If not, don't get crazy about it. Just start making little steps, little steps forward. Auto messages. Set them up. I'll send you in telegram. I will send you how to set up hand responses in Gmail and instant replies in Instagram. They really make a big difference. It just takes a few minutes to set them up. Think about time vultures, whether that's a problematic client, whether that's some celebrity who drives you crazy and they keep showing up on your feed, unfollow block. They're gone. Think about notifications on your phone. If your phone is buzzing tonight, if your phone's age, you get little notifications from whatever app. Turn them off. Turn them off. You'll forget one day later, you'll forget there were even notifications of thing. Your phone will just sit there, dark on the table, uninteresting. Think about buying back your time. What ways could you do that? What ways could you free up your time? Do you have a friend or a relative or somebody you know? Could you post a simple ad to get somebody to help you a little bit? Maybe it's not today. Maybe you're not ready for that now, but in a few months, somebody to free up a little bit of your time so you have more time to invest in the assets that you're building. Your job is not to be doing everything, everything forever. Part of building a business is building opportunities. So your next step in terms of doing that is freeing up your time by getting some of the stuff done around your home that perhaps you're not doing now. Okay, great to have you guys here. Here's what happens now. I will do a quick reset here, and I'll see you back in just a minute for the Q and A. If you have questions, use the Q and A form, but I will open up for live questions as well. I'll see you in just a minute."}]}
