{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "this is the content not showing up in the chat history- let me know if it is too much: Question: We are ramping up and separating our residential service and install business at accurate door because workflows and competencies are different than our commercial workflow. We will need a project plan, sample text notifications, samples of short and pointed marketing language, hiring plan, along with SMART goals, plus any other items you can imagine in a project of this scope. Some details you need to know- we are creating total visibility between the office, field technician, and customer. In traditional home service businesses there is a knowledge and communication gap between the office dispatching the call and technician collecting payment.  This causes miscommunication, preventable return calls, frustration for all parties, especially the customer, and stress for leadership or management.  We want to promise the customer total visibility between them and our processes, 2 experts on every call, a service concierge for every call, higher value with lower costs, faster resolution, at least 3 dependable options for the repair of existing garage doors or installation of new doors. And much more. We plan on using smart glasses and remote experts who we are right now calling service concierges, but that position name is debatable. Internally we are calling them desk techs. The important part is they are trained experts who are using 'see what I see' technology to ensure accountability for promises made, quality of work performed, speed of work performed, frictionless buying experiences, while reducing time and dollar costs to them. It is foundation for our customer journey and out technician career journey. It will allow us to build a larger customer base and hire new people almost at will as it will reduce training times and expense to the business. Can you help me get started on a plan to do this project and recommend language that communicates this to existing team and each new customer? \nAnswer: Sure, I can help you get started on a plan to separate your residential service and install business and create total visibility between the office, field technician, and customer.

This can include phrases such as \"total visibility,\" \"2 experts on every call,\" \"faster resolution,\" and \"frictionless buying experience.\"\n\nDevelop a hiring plan: Identify the skills and qualifications required for the new positions of service concierge and desk tech. Develop a recruitment strategy and an onboarding plan for new hires.\n\nSet SMART goals: Develop specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals for the project.

I libri dicono questo, ma loro non vogliono vedere quella parte.\n\n00:00:53:12 - 00:01:03:01\nDovresti capire il vero potere che risuona dentro di te, e dovresti essere in grado di comandare la tua realtà, comandare alle cose di esistere.\n\n00:01:03:01 - 00:01:06:23\nE non significa che vai in giro con una bacchetta magica creando pianeti e cose del genere.\n\n00:01:06:23 - 00:01:14:01\nMa significa che viviamo in un universo frattale e frattale significa fondamentalmente che tu sei una piccola parte del tutto.\n\n00:01:14:01 - 00:01:16:26\nPer renderlo molto semplice e non diventare troppo scientifico e troppo tecnico.\n\n00:01:16:26 - 00:01:28:00\nNon voglio perderti con le parole.

Può solo raccogliere dati.\n\n00:02:58:19 - 00:03:06:14\nE ritrasmette quei dati al cervello, che è racchiuso nella completa oscurità, e il tuo cervello risolve tutto e poi proietta l'ologramma su cosa sta succedendo là fuori.\n\n00:03:06:14 - 00:03:10:01\nE navighi attraverso il matrix basandoti su quell'ologramma.\n\n00:03:10:01 - 00:03:15:20\nEd è così che azionate e manovrate il corpo del vostro avatar attraverso questo campo elettromagnetico che chiamiamo terza dimensione.\n\n00:03:15:20 - 00:03:30:24\nTutto esiste solo come onde elettromagnetiche fino a quando l'osservatore cosciente fa collassare le vibrazioni, che sono informazioni, a una vibrazione più lenta, che ora possiamo identificare come materia o solidità, ma in verità la solidità e la materia anche la distanza è tutta un'illusione.\n\n00:03:30:24 - 00:03:40:15\nMa quando dico che sei Dio, devi capire che hai gli stessi poteri di comando di un'energia divina solo in una forma molto piccola e frattalizzata all'interno del tuo stesso corpo.\n\n00:03:40:15 - 00:03:45:10\nE quando capisci questo capisci che devi muoverti con forza ed energia nella terza dimensione.\n\n00:03:45:10 - 00:03:56:25\nNon puoi entrare nella terza dimensione e muoverti attraverso questo matrix con una mentalità debole, con la mentalità dell'elemosina, della speranza, del desiderio, della disperazione e del dubbio, quelle sono vibrazioni a bassa frequenza.\n\n00:03:56:25 - 00:03:58:29\nDevi aumentare le tue vibrazioni.\n\n00:03:58:29 - 00:04:02:00\nDevi comandare questo universo, devi vivere con potere.\n\n00:04:02:00 - 00:04:05:00\nQuando entri in una stanza dovresti sentire il potere.\n\n00:04:05:00 - 00:04:07:28\nDovresti avere il potere che esce da te ed arriva dentro di te.\n\n00:04:07:28 - 00:04:19:06\nQuando devi effettuare una transazione commerciale, dovresti operare con una mentalità di potere. \"Ordino che questa transazione d'affari vada a mio favore.\"\n\n00:04:19:06 - 00:04:25:03\n“Che funzionerà a mio favore. Che mi avvantaggia in un modo che mi consente di progredire in ciò che sto cercando di realizzare.\n\n00:04:25:03 - 00:04:32:27\nQuesti sono i tipi di mentalità. Quando entri in una transazione in questo modo, con una mentalità di potere positivo, una mentalità di potere con l'universo,\n\n00:04:32:27 - 00:04:35:15\nnon una mentalità debole di accattonaggio. \"Oh, spero che funzioni.\"\n\n00:04:35:15 - 00:04:39:26\n\"Oh, spero che questo accada per me.\" Questa mentalità porterà a scarsi risultati.\n\n00:04:39:26 - 00:04:43:19\nQuesto è quello che sto cercando di dirvi ragazzi, quando dico che siete dei. Il potere è dentro di voi.\n\n00:04:43:19 - 00:04:47:13\nDovete imparare a comandarlo, comandare alle cose di esistere.\n\n00:04:47:13 - 00:04:50:06\nE volete un esempio molto semplice di questo?\n\n00:04:50:06 - 00:04:55:09\nVi darò un po' reali, semplici esempi in modo che possiate capire quello che sto dicendo.\n\n00:04:55:09 - 00:05:04:21\nIl cellulare che sto usando in questo momento per parlare con voi ragazzi, questo cellulare era un concetto, un pensiero nel cervello di qualcuno.\n\n00:05:04:21 - 00:05:11:23\nQuindi, prima che questo cellulare fosse qui in forma fisica, nella terza dimensione, era un pensiero nel cervello di qualcuno.\n\n00:05:11:23 - 00:05:21:09\nQualcuno ha pensato a questo potenziale telefono, alla forma, alle misure, alle dimensioni, a come sarebbe stato, che tipo di schermo avrebbe avuto, quali sarebbero state le funzioni.\n\n00:05:21:09 - 00:05:25:24\nE si sono concentrati su di esso. E ci hanno pensato nella loro mente, hanno pensato e pensato e pensato.\n\n00:05:25:24 - 00:05:28:29\nHanno detto, ok, questo è ciò che voglio manifestare ora.\n\n00:05:28:29 - 00:05:33:21\nQuindi hanno preso questo pensiero, e lo hanno trasmesso a chi?\n\n00:05:33:21 - 00:05:40:23\nAd un progettista tecnologico, che poi lo ha portato in una forma bidimensionale inserendolo in un foglio e anche in un computer.\n\n00:05:40:23 - 00:05:43:11\nOra è un rendering bidimensionale di un pensiero.\n\n00:05:43:11 - 00:05:53:23\nQuindi quel pensiero si è ora manifestato da una piattaforma di coscienza in un piano operativo di piattaforma tridimensionale ma bidimensionale.\n\n00:05:53:23 - 00:05:58:22\nE poi da quel piano bidimensionale, un ingegnere lo prende e lo converte in un oggetto tridimensionale.\n\n00:05:58:22 - 00:06:04:07\nQuindi i tuoi pensieri iniziano sul piano cosciente,\n\n00:06:04:07 - 00:06:12:18\nfiniscono in un piano bidimensionale, e questo serve per creare oggetti che utilizziamo nella terza dimensione. Tutto, dalla tua macchina ai tuoi vestiti, a tutto ciò che è artificiale.\n\n00:06:12:18 - 00:06:14:06\nTutto inizia nello stesso processo.\n\n00:06:14:06 - 00:06:22:13\nPiano cosciente, piano bidimensionale verso un piano tridimensionale, un oggetto tridimensionale che può effettivamente essere toccato fisicamente, raccolto e manovrato nella terza dimensione.\n\n00:06:22:13 - 00:06:26:23\nTutto inizia con cosa? Un pensiero.\n\n00:06:26:23 - 00:06:34:12\nQuindi quando dico alle persone che siamo Dio e che abbiamo il potere di creare e loro ridono, dubitano e dicono, sei pazzo.\n\n00:06:34:12 - 00:06:46:00\nBene, se non fosse vero allora, non avresti nemmeno un cellulare con cui parlare con me perché la persona che ha pensato al cellulare che tieni in mano proprio in questo secondo, ha creato quel cellulare dal pensiero alla manifestazione nel terza dimensione.\n\n00:06:46:00 - 00:06:50:15\nE lo facciamo con ogni singola cosa che abbiamo che è fatta dall'uomo, letteralmente.\n\n00:06:50:15 - 00:06:57:29\nNon mi interessa cosa sia. Qualcuno ha pensato alla forma e alle dimensioni di una scatola, e cosa è successo? Si è manifestata nella realtà tridimensionale.\n\n00:06:57:29 - 00:07:05:29\nQualcuno ha pensato alla forma e alle dimensioni di un veicolo su cui qualcuno può sedersi e viaggiare. E cosa è successo? Si è manifestato nella realtà tridimensionale.\n\n00:07:05:29 - 00:07:10:22\nTutto ciò che abbiamo che è fatto dall'uomo è iniziato sotto forma di pensiero. Come sopra così sotto.\n\n00:07:10:22 - 00:07:15:16\nProprio come il creatore di questo universo è un creatore che crea costantemente.\n\n00:07:15:16 - 00:07:26:10\nBene, indovinate un po' ragazzi? Come sopra così sotto. Abbiamo lo stesso identico tipo di sistema dell'energia del creatore. Ed è per questo che anche noi stessi creiamo su base coerente,\n\n00:07:26:10 - 00:07:30:13\ngli esseri umani creano ogni singolo giorno, sette giorni alla settimana, 24 ore al giorno.\n\n00:07:30:13 - 00:07:31:25\nNoi creiamo, creiamo, creiamo, creiamo.\n\n00:07:31:25 - 00:07:37:13\nSe non lo facessimo, qui non ci sarebbe niente. Vivremmo nudi in una caverna.\n\n00:07:37:13 - 00:07:46:25\nE non lo stiamo facendo. Stiamo operando e muovendoci attraverso questo matrix utilizzando la tecnologia e le cose che abbiamo creato per noi stessi, come strumenti e vestiti\n\n00:07:46:25 - 00:07:53:12\ne automobili, aeroplani e tecnologia di tutti i diversi tipi. Come mai? Perché ci abbiamo pensato\n\n00:07:53:12 - 00:08:01:00\nsul piano cosciente, poi si è spostato in un piano bidimensionale, e poi da lì è entrato in una terza dimensione, nella realtà fisica.\n\n00:08:01:00 - 00:08:02:19\nQuindi siamo creatori.\n\n00:08:02:19 - 00:08:07:09\nQuindi, quando ti dico che hai Dio dentro, quella è l'energia divina che ti permette di creare.\n\n00:08:07:09 - 00:08:12:01\nLa gente dà per scontato che abbiamo tutta questa roba.\n\n00:08:12:01 - 00:08:18:12\nNo amico. Tu sei un creatore. Ognuno di noi ha il potere di creare. Tu sei Dio.\n\n00:08:18:12 - 00:08:22:01\nPunto. Capiscilo. Usalo.\n\n00:08:22:01 - 00:08:25:11\nDovete comprendere che il potere che è già dentro di voi ragazzi.\n\n00:08:25:11 - 00:08:27:02\nE poi vedrete di cosa sto parlando.\n\n00:08:27:02 - 00:08:30:18\nCapirete il messaggio esoterico che sto cercando di trasmettervi."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "3 / 4\"Organize this transcript into a detailed status report; listing all people on the call, any topics discussed and sub bullets of action items raised, thoughts, comments, concerns and opportunities moving forward.\"\nThis report should be a resource for anyone to read and understand what the key points were.\n\n\n \nShirin Safavy\n00:34\nso as far as our agenda for today i'll walk us through\nour goals and objectives. From this past year\ni'll cover an executive summary our accomplishments together.\nand then we'll talk through campaign performance.\nand Sandy will take over from there and walk through some insights and learnings, and\nwe'll wrap up with opportunities and next steps.\nSo our biggest goal for 2022 was to create awareness of the Qsp Partner program\nspecifically talking to the Isv.\nAnd Msp audiences, which was something that has not been done before\n \nShirin Safavy\n01:51\nSo our end goal\nfor this year was to increase partner sales of the cute\nquickbook solutions.\nwe also wanted to create some educational opportunities for partners so that they could more effectively market and sell these solutions, especially the quick books online solution.\nAnd i'm not gonna read through everything. There's a lot to talk through today. So if there's something you see on here that we didn't cover\nfeel free to ask about that\nlater in the meeting.\nSo in 2,022, we provided over 5,700 new leads we did this by developing and launching lead Gen. Programs for partner recruitment\nand through partner marketing\nwe managed a total of 16 webinars, including the execution\nwhich freed up a lot of time for Gina and her team.\nWe hosted and developed marketing best practices content, and we did this\nfor 7 monthly meet the expert series.\nand we also refined the Isv. And msp messaging, so that we can better address the needs of those audiences.\nSo what did we accomplish?\nI just mentioned that we generated over 5,700 leads.\nhere's how they break down. So 3 300 of those were generated for Isv.\nMs. P. For the partner recruitment.\nand a little over 2,400 leads were through Webinar registrations\nand Content Syndication programs.\nWe also created a newsletter in Mailchim. This was for leads that had completed the nurture, but didn't convert\nand traffic on the on 24 site pages were significantly increased so previously. They were a little under 200\nper week.\nand they have increased to over a 1,000 per week.\nAs far as nurture campaigns. We developed 2 separate tracks with 5 touches each one for ISP and one for Msp.\nThese were sent out on a weekly cadence, and began in April of 2,022\nas you can see below. Under the offer column we used a variety of assets.\nUnfortunately, we'd already use the existing ebook for Content Syndication, so we used a mix of blogs, case studies and\npapers\nfor these 5 touches.\nHere on the right, we have a couple of samples of these emails. One for is one for Msp.\nThe metrics for the ISP\nnurture track were to get significantly higher.\nYou can see the numbers here are well above industry standard averages, and as far as the Msp. Audience goes\nthese rates. They're not bad. They're just closer to the standards of the industry.\n \nSandi Settle\n05:18\nYeah, I think there's an opportunity here for us to work on the messaging for the Msps. That's one thing to point out to to kind of dial that in a little bit better.\n \nHoward Sewell\n05:26\nExactly. I I will stress, if I may just jump in. I you know, I think of industry standards, for a houseless like this is sort of, you know, 10 to 15% somewhere in there as being kind of, you know, a to good.\nSo 20% is nothing to be ashamed of or the click rate for that matter. But we've set ourselves a high bar, which is which is great, and and there's always room for for testing and optimization.\n \nAnila Baseel\n05:53\nI think these are great numbers. because the average industry rate for the open rate, it's not 20% right. It's probably less than that.\n \nHoward Sewell\n06:01\nYeah, definitely.\nYep. Exactly.\n \nGina Madson\n06:04\nYeah. And we're excited as we go into this next year we're going to have a lot more content. Both success stories and testimonials. So I think I hope that new, fresh, engaging content, especially a lot of video content will also play into better click through rates and the nurtures as well.\n \nAnila Baseel\n06:24\nAnd you know, I would add this because we probably need to start thinking about franchise, too.\non that.\nYeah, it's a big opportunity here. So we should talk about that for sure.\n \nGina Madson\n06:37\nOkay.\n \nSandi Settle\n06:40\nwe're here to help Gina.\n \nShirin Safavy\n06:46\nSo another accomplishment where the office hours webinars these consisted of spear speakers.\nUnfortunately, we don't have data for the earlier sessions. But we have really good data for the past 3 months, and we'll continue\nto have that in the future. So we can compare each session to the last.\n \nSandi Settle\n07:07\nYeah. Our hope is also to do some serving of your partners to see what they want to learn more about, and the type of content that they're interested in. But we'll build out a series for next year.\nWith that information, I think we're slated for February for our first one\n \nUnknown Speaker\n07:25\nfor 2,023.\n \nShirin Safavy\n07:26\nYes, that's correct.\nAnd here are some samples of the partner creatives These are the emails we sent through our third party partner\nand promoted through content. Syndication.\nyou can see at the top we use dual logos. So the quick books logo is always at the top right, and the partner Logo is on the left.\nWe strategically chose images that fit each industry. And you can see below in these samples we played around with the buttons to determine\nwhere\nthe best performance is. based on button placement, and determine that\nthe 2 green ones top placement performs best.\n \nAnila Baseel\n08:11\nand do we have numbers on how the messaging may have done like between. Notify Mendelssohn and margin Edge, like what resonated better with the audience.\n \nSandi Settle\n08:23\nWell, their audiences are a bit different because they're different industries. For the most part we can go back and analyze and take a look at them.\n \nAnila Baseel\n08:32\nI know we did a series. We did more for some of the partners than others, so we don't have as much to kind of compare to, but we can look at that, because we have the data and the performance, and each of them I'm asking is like, I see one of them is Nsp. Mandelson. The rest are. Is these\nWhat the feedback we got from is this was that they're looking more for us to do a\ncustomization approach in terms of messaging.\nThey have their own solution integrated to quick books. We have our own. So how do we make that peanut butter, jelly, sandwich kind of thing approach right with is. so i'm just wondering if one of them resonated better where we have more of a connected messaging.\n \nSandi Settle\n09:18\nOkay.\nwe'll take a look at that.\n \nGina Madson\n09:22\nYeah, I know for notify and margin edge we provide spear with the co-value proposition\n \nAnila Baseel\n09:28\ncontent and messaging. So yeah, it'd be curious to see if we do better with those that you guys did. we are working towards that Co. Marketing messaging. Okay?\n \nSandi Settle\n09:44\nWell, I think you'll see some of that. a little Further, we have a surprise to show you.\n \nShirin Safavy\n09:54\nOkay, and moving on to the part Prospect Partner Newsletter. So\nthe data below is for the first issue, which went out pretty recently on November first.\nclicks look good click to open rates look pretty great.\nSo\n \nSandi Settle\n10:12\nthe one thing we learned from this is we obviously need more content. So some of this is is also reaching out or utilizing some industry content as well. For educational purposes that we think you know they would be interested in, but we'd love more.\nI\ninto it related content.\nfor these newsletters moving forward.\n \nAnila Baseel\n10:36\nSorry I, my mindful, but I mentioned here. I think this for recruit. Probably.\nso. I almost feel like in the title is grabbing their attention because quick books is a big name. That's the o open rate that shows is.\n \nSandi Settle\n10:54\nand the CTO. Specifically, which is great\n \nAnila Baseel\n10:58\nWonder if we can align. And this is our problem. If we can align those leads to how we closed internally, or I'll be the right ones.\n \nGina Madson\n11:10\nSo this is the the Newsletter that we just started sending monthly Anila, and it's going to the long term nurture. So the leads that have already gone through sales and haven't converted yet so that this kind of like our drip continuing to message to them.\nso we've only yeah. I had the last month, really. And then the second one went out the beginning of December. But that's for sure something we're trying to track internally, and you know, like pass over. If someone re-engages\nand starts to raise our hand at the bottom of every Newsletter. It's a call to action to, you know, book time with LED basically so we're trying to promote that with these.\n \nAnila Baseel\n11:50\nSo, Gina, we don't know how many we got through meetings with LED\n \nGina Madson\n11:54\nas of this one. I don't believe any have been booked with end from the Newsletter right now, because they're overly a newsletter, and they're like, Wait, this is this is nothing. So we\nagain, if if it was all a 100% Qsp. Content, and they may not feel relevant either. So we need to\nchange up the mix of content. We had, you know, more industry, available news and\ncontent available. So that's kind of what we use, but\nthat isn't the plan long term.\n \nSandi Settle\n12:26\nRight?\n \nUnknown Speaker\n12:32\nOkay?\n \nShirin Safavy\n12:34\nOkay. So this chart on the right shows engagement time on the\npartner sites between February and October of this year.\nYou can see the time on the site is pretty low. It's not where we want to be. We want to increase engagement to keep people coming back.\nSo that is definitely something. We'll continue to work on\n \nSandi Settle\n12:59\nOne thing to call out there to the time on site\nwill help with refreshing, you know. As we get more content they'll have more reason to come back more frequently to, you know, spend time on site. They\nright now we're using the site more to come for one purpose like to register for something, and then they pop off. What we want to do is is, keep them there. Keep them looking, going deeper into the site, and so forth. So\nwe have talked to Gina about, you know, building out. Maybe some industry pages and things like that. what we can do as far as promotion of that site is limited because it's on on 24\nSomething to think about in the future is potentially building it like a micro site or something that we could actually do some social promotion to\nwe're limited in that now, but content is a big factor in keeping them there\n \nGina Madson\n13:54\nright. This is our on 24 hub, so it's not a main website. but it's where our lower content and our Webinar registrations are housed. So\nnot\nexactly a main partner website, but that is something that's in the works for\nfor next year. What I was also thinking right for future discussion is.\n \nAnila Baseel\n14:15\nwe have this. We're also internally working on our quickbooks.com site\nto add partner specific page, and we have to drive that page also. So when you talk about a micro site\nthat could be a gateway coming into our quick books. Right? so we can drive traffic one. Another driver would be our directory. So we're hoping to get that more robust, and that's going to be our partners outward facing to customers.\nOkay. So how do we help them generate on the for marketing piece there? Also?\n \nUnknown Speaker\n14:58\nOkay.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:01\nSorry. Taking notes.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:05\nI think it is important to note just looking at this chart here that visitors have been increasing.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:11\nSo, we're headed in the right direction.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:14\nAnd\nnow that we're seeing momentum with visitors, we just want to keep them there longer and keep them coming back.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:23\nExactly.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:28\nOh, now it's happening again.\n \nSandi Settle\n15:30\nI\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:31\nThere we go.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:37\nOkay.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:38\nSo campaign. Sorry, guys.\nit's like it knows everybody is on this. Call it doesn't want to cooperate.\nSo looking at the nurture campaign results, As I mentioned earlier, we had 2 separate tracks, 5 touches each.\nYou can see we're pretty close to industry averages. Those are listed at the very bottom of this chart.\nSome touches performed better than others. we've recently been working on rewriting some of this copy, so we do look forward to seeing how they'll measure in the next few months. Compared\nto these measurements.\nand the Msp. Track actually performed much better than is V. Which makes sense. When you think about it, because most of the assets we used, or\nvery closely related to Msp.\nfor example, this third touch here performed really well.\nSo.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n16:42\nhmm.\n \nShirin Safavy\n16:44\nAnother thing I wanted to point out is that in the beginning of our engagement we were sending these emails manually. So Spear was manually going into mailchimp and sending the touches out each week.\nand as we added to the series, and had a complete set of 5, we were able to recreate the nurture within mailch as an automated series.\nSo and gina i'm sure you remember that.\nSo I want to be sure that you know these numbers are based on the automated series, not the manual.\n \nGina Madson\n17:14\nOkay.\n \nShirin Safavy\n17:19\nAnd this is a summary slide of the partner Webinar programs for post-event promotion.\nThese partners receive content syndication leads after their webinar.\nAnd the reason there's no costs per lead for the first one for margin edge is because we used and make good for that project\n \nAnila Baseel\n17:42\nfor these numbers.\nI I guess I need to understand what the definition of lead is. is it just? if it is just attendees. Then let's call it out. 1 50 attendees right? Because when we'd say, when we talk about these numbers to sales, they like leads\noh, leads. They consider as qualified. So, unless we have a qualification, we should probably say attendees. The other thing is from for my team. I think we we're at a point, Gina, where we could look at these coming in. And if we, how can we\ncontinue the journey of where these are from the partner, and that's going to be a tough one.\n \nGina Madson\n18:24\nYeah. So with these ones we have report the attendees and the registrants separately. And then this was actually after the fact. After the Webinar. We syndicated it as a piece that someone could go out and register for and targeted that syndication through spears, various\nagencies right to those targeted audiences. So these leads are people that clicked on it and said, oh, I want to watch that Webinar i'm, you know, going to register. So then we pass them over to the Qsp. And they fit the audience criteria that you're looking for. Specifically.\n \nSandi Settle\n19:00\nSo\nit it's kinda in between. They've raised their hand. They're interested, and they fit the right profile as\nas a lead.\n \nGina Madson\n19:08\nright? And so the feedback we've gotten from hinge and margin edge so where I Haven't heard definitively from asterisk. But that is, these are really good quality, and that they are the contacts that they want at the companies that they want to be talking to\nbut it's been mixed as they're reaching out to them, and that that lead is like\nvery familiar with it, and understand who they are and why they're reaching out to. Okay, yeah.\nI just clicked on that. It does sound interesting to me. But why are you calling me right. So like it is definitely a top of funnel lead. But it's getting them like I said, the right people at the right companies to fill that top of funnel. Then it's up to the partner to really nurture them.\n \nAnila Baseel\n19:50\nYeah, i'm wondering if we could do anything with and lift all this and and lift it a partner that we have\nwhere you know they're looking at data and a lot of vertical specific stuff. And so, even just to understand like for margin edge, or if we bucket them into verticals, so hinge full margin edge if they do a concer i'm just making this up. I don't know construction, or you know a\ninventory management solution. What are the profiles that we're looking at? Because there's going to be a lot of partners. I see specifically that are playing in the same vertical. And so how do we segment each of their specialty into that? So that's something that we could, you know, do but i'm just mentioning to.\nGina Lexi and Louise is\nif there's an if if we can create a almost like a propensity model on for each of the verticals.\n \nHoward Sewell\n20:49\nquick question. Actually, we're going to touch upon\npropensity a little later on in the in the deck quick. This question almost for for both teams. But i'm wondering in light of Gina's comment about the mixed response to outreach. Can we help provide guidance, or maybe sample scripts, or anything to these partners, one\nfor their outreach, because we hear that a lot with content syndication programs occasionally, whether the clients where leads get thrown over the fence to sales. Sales thinks they are following up on people that have expressed interest in the product. Basically\nAnd there is so. So there is sort of like a disconnect when you know. So i'm just wondering if that's something that we can\nmaybe help\nguide in a\nin a gentle way, and improve that.\nImprove that response for sure, open to it. I mean, we are pretty\n \nGina Madson\n21:40\nclear with the marketer at the queue at the partner right? That like that's what happened. This is what happened, but i'm not there controlling how they're passing into sales, and I don't know right. I think march and edge is an exception. but for him to go I know that they don't have refined\nnurture process right and different levels of sales who would be reaching out at different times. So for sure, it's something that we can do better and enable our usps with better.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n22:13\nOkay.\n \nHoward Sewell\n22:15\ncool.\n \nSandi Settle\n22:16\nYeah, I think we'll touch on it a little further down to, as you know, some of the challenges with understanding, you know. Measurement on the back end of how they, how they're doing, and how they're, you know, moving through the funnel.\ncertainly would love to be more involved in, you know. Get more transparent feedback from them, so that we can put that into our campaigns and follow up\nyour screen.\n \nShirin Safavy\n22:45\nGreat. So I will hand things over to Sandy.\n \nSandi Settle\n22:48\nAll right next slide, please.\nSo we asked Gina upfront here. if she could do a swat analysis of our relationship.\nso that we could, you know, ensure we're giving the best service possible. You know. What do we do? Well, what can we improve? I won't. Go through and read all of this, but I wanted it as part of the deck, because it is something that we're working. You know.\nWe're keeping front of mine and working on some of the things that you mentioned, where you know we do really well at the kind of lead, generation side on content, syndication and campaign execution, working on the webinars content.\nplanning and strategy. and then I I do think our relationship between our team is is strong that communication is great.\nSome areas that we can improve our, you know, on timelines. we're actively looking at ways that we can.\nyou know, keep that. Keep the projects moving quickly, making sure that we're hitting those timelines, and we, you know we added more resources onto the account as well, and Lynn and her team have been working harder on, you know.\nrefining the the messaging and trying to get those. You know the audience messaging just right. So we're gonna continuously work on that\nand we're looking at different vendors to also to see how we can refine the audience a little bit better for you as well, and finding new ways to reach. You know your target Audience.\nnext slide, please.\n \nAnila Baseel\n24:26\nSo I just on that.\nI know Gina and I talk quite a bit and thank you for sharing the learning on the content piece. Right? I mean, I know that, you guys you've tried and stuff. But honestly, we have agencies that we work with very in a, you know, deeper workshop place, and they've been on board, and they really integrated so\nhonestly from that point of view, we could get to some of the content that we've already created. And one thing that we have put in place is Harry on our team is doing the overall messaging, and we just tap into those, you know messages, right? So we're. We are putting things in place that are better because we understand that there's different places where we are going to use that content from. So you know, there's there's improvements happening on our site as well.\n \nSandi Settle\n25:14\nOh, absolutely. We know that there there are things in place. I know some things have been stuck in legal, and there have been some challenges with people being gone, and you know, nothing moves as quickly as as we would like them to, but we definitely have probably hit\nthe end of the content that we have now. So we're eagerly awaiting, you know, new assets moving forward. But if there's ever a need to do that, and we hope to be doing that more with some of the partners themselves with the marketplace program.\nThat, you know. That would be wonderful, too, is to be able to show up to share some of that.\nwe also looked at some of the opportunities and threats just to get some feedback on the industry itself. and you know, if there's any gaps in our service, or where we could help more. and so we were listening on here. We realized that you know most of the social has moved over to corporate.\nBut if there's anything that we can do from the standpoint of creating content or posts, or anything to you know. Move that along faster. Obviously we're here for you.\nLet's see here.\nwe're doing our best to get the most out of your budget to drive new leads for the Qs themselves, and also for the partner Acquisition.\nI think here we all see that the industry is slowing slightly. and budgets are, you know.\nbeing held closely.\nbut I still think that we've seen a lot of successes, and we're able to apply that kind of moving forward to get more and more efficient at helping those partners, you know, find better ways to reach their audiences and target those messages more clearly.\nNext slide, please.\nSo overall what we think went well was the communication between our teams. You know we've had really open honest discussions, but things don't work, and when they do Gina has been great at sharing everything that she sees on her side that help, you know. Help us all do better.\nwe've had the ability to test different approaches and pivot. You know quickly when things aren't working.\nwe have some resources in place that help us, you know. Get better organized and communicate better. I think we review things very quickly. The teams got open flow of communication between the channels and the\nthe regular meetings as well. we have some flexibility and adding\nadditional resources on the sphere side when there's upticks in work. So we've brought more people onto the team, and we I think we have a solid team in place.\nNext slide, please.\nSome of the challenges we, you know we had a hard time with that live Webinar\nevent promotion upfront. We learned from that, and I think we've been able to do a lot better.\nReplacing that offer with the on demand recordings and doing the promotions on the back end. also increasing kind of the mix of content that we have to work with so ebooks and case studies and things like that. when possible. Ebooks, obviously are, are one of the\nthe pieces most in demand.\nyou we discussed the partner commitment needed to kind of complete the post event. Follow up, and maybe this is an opportunity for us to help help you help them by creating some.\nmaybe best practices, as Ha! Hey? Howard had mentioned on scripts, and, you know, follow up emails to kind of level out the playing field for those partners that may not have the resources to do that.\nWe recommended kind of the creation of some\ntop of funnel ebook assets that incorporate things like case studies or snippets and testimonials. But that has a little bit more of a thought leadership. Focus. Those do much better in the ads than you know, sending them to just landing pages to go kind of look for content themselves.\nOur lack of ebook and white paper assets kind of made some of the lead generation efforts to little challenging for contents, education and and paid media advertising.\nSo we we, as I said before, we could use a little bit more of a mix of assets to kind of freshen those nurtures, and continue with the monthly newsletters. populating those. So there's no big surprises there\nmessaging.\nyou know we did find that we need some differentiation on the messaging between the audiences. They were a little too similar, I think, as you said we're working on it. It's been getting better and better.\nthe Intuit team has provided us more information, any background such as you know, surveys or any feedback that you got from your events last week, that potentially we can kind of incorporate that into the messaging\nto make it a little bit. You know more refined\nreporting as an area that we still are having some challenges, I would say, in in measuring how we're doing from a revenue, perspective and opportunities to a generated from the programs that we're doing so potentially getting salesforce access or\nregular reporting from that could help also getting some reporting from the partners themselves\nwould be beneficial.\nthe on 24 landing pages are acceptable, but\nthe fact that there's only kind of one version of the form makes some of the lead generation that we want to do.\nyou know, unattainable we recommend, maybe designing and building additional landing pages with new forms and mailchimp potentially in that in the future\nthat will help with the lead Gen. Needs, and enable us to kind of measure more\nthat lack of engagement tracking and the results from meet the experts. As we go forward, so we can kind of see how we're doing on those that would be helpful as well.\nand let's see mailchimp, you know. Mail 10 third. There are some\nareas there where we can't quite build some of the templates that we want to Some of the modules just had to be kind of tweaked to translate\nvisually in mailchimp\nbut we were able to kind of overcome that with the newsletter\nareas of opportunity the content development is is one of those areas where\nwe could use a little mix of content for the industry pages potentially creating content that's specific to those different industries. So whether it's construction or inventory management.\nmaybe creating some more content that's specific to those industries. the potential to maybe survey or interview partners to to find topics of interest, or, you know, get some some expertise on messaging from them\nidentifying cop topics of interest from your conference. I know we haven't had a chance to talk about how it went last week, but we look forward to hearing a little bit about that\nthe creation of the partner. Videos case studies and blogs that you're talking about will be exciting. for the New Year.\npotentially refreshing. That messaging based on, you know, audience surveys or interviews. is a a potential area of opportunity, and also to extend that nurture.\nconsider, maybe adding the event in a box to the menu of services for the partners for the the partner marketplace.\nwhere, since\nmany of the partners are getting back into doing live events, maybe that's an in the area of opportunity where we can package that, like we talked about earlier in the year into a program.\nand then building a monthly program for tracking on the activities that we're doing for the partners. So maybe there's a way to incentivize the partners, maybe to send back revenue or opportunity results from those Content syndication programs and other things.\nso that we can kind of get some more 2 way feedback.\nAny questions there?\n \nUnknown Speaker\n34:08\nOkay.\n \nGina Madson\n34:09\nNot a good question. But just I think on it\ncomment for the Content development. I mean any of this is something we had talked about at different points, but as we get more Qsps and have more verticalized focused content for recruiting or finding customers, I should say, for our Qsps\nwith on 24, if we had a deeper set of content right. We could have some more of those always on kind of\n \nUnknown Speaker\n34:36\ngo ahead.\n \nGina Madson\n34:37\nGoogle as as well as complementary content syndication campaigns going that are for the vertical. So then we're getting and passing weeds for partners, right? Which I know we're not yet at from a corporate standpoint, but that's kind of an option to explore down the road.\n \nAnila Baseel\n34:55\nYeah, I actually made a note sending on and you, Haven't here is.\ncan we maybe do a a focus group with the partners right? Specifically? one. A focus group for is one for Msps and really understand. Look, this is what we've delivered so far. What?\nWhat is all the things that you\nmay use right.\nThey've been doing business before even they became our partner\nfor a long time. They know how to get leads and how we land those. So if we were to leverage that information and their expertise. How do we enable them? Maybe they might be something that you know, because we're all there with some marketers, and\nyou get into our little bubble of like, hey marketing, should we do this? But sometimes when you hear things from sales, it's a light bulb going off. Oh, wait! We could have tweaked it this way, so it'd be great, because we have a lot of activities under the belt. And so how do we create the next, you know, level of\nenablement for the partners. If that's focus group that they'll be open to and trust me. Our qs are pretty open, and their voice their opinion. It'd be great to have those, you know. Call it the suggestion. I know you already have that on your board.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n36:09\nRight?\n \nSandi Settle\n36:10\nYeah, I think that would be wonderful.\nThe more information they have, the more you know more we can refine.\nand with that said, we do have an in one idea that Howard is going to talk about with an an additional partner that we work with.\nNext slide. Please\n \nHoward Sewell\n36:29\ncut my cue. That's your cue\nI got. I got given a couple of slides, so i'd feel useful. which is very nice. yeah, i'll go through this quickly, but you know, full disclosure. Rev. Is a a very new partner relationship for us. In fact, it's, you know we Haven't even really formalized\nthe relationship. But they're a really interesting company, and one that we on the spear side.\nI think that we could leverage across a pretty broad swath of client engagements, and we're in a mode right now in the early stages where we've done a couple of little tests with a couple of clients, and we're looking to do a few more. 3.\nTo gauge how clients could leverage the the data that comes out of these tests, which i'll explain so Rev. Is a. A company. Basically it's a AI-based technology, and they build a\na model of your Icp ideal customer profile based on a list of your best customers. So you give them a list of 20 customers, and say, these are: If we had another 500 of these, that would be, that would be great, and they feed that into their model and output.\na couple of things. One is other companies that look like those same customers.\nAnd secondly, what are the common characteristics that define those companies beyond the usual pharmographic. So\ngeography, company, size, industry, etc., but also what Rev. Calls hexagraphics, which is basically information on how companies execute. So\nare they an early adopter or a late adopter? Are they focused on customer service, that sort of thing, and they also they build that model based on the list the company provides. They run it against a database of 6 million dollars, 6 million companies.\nThey identify those key characteristics, and then they also come back to us with. Here are other companies that look like\nthe companies you're telling us\nare\nyour best customers.\nIf you can go to the next slide.\nShreen. Thank you.\nso this has been. we've done this a couple of times now. In fact, we're presenting our second to another client this later this week, but it has the potential to be a useful tool, we believe, on a couple of fronts one\nit could identify other, but other Isvs and Msps that are out there that are most similar to the partners that you want best to capture and bring into the program. It may identify\nspecific.\nhigh potential segment. So we may. It may be a way to identify\nthat we didn't realise it, but the partners who sell to this type of company, or that have the certain characteristic end up being our top performing partners. And if we learn more about\nwhat makes those\npartners your best\npartners, it could help inform things like messaging and content, and and that sort of thing. So our offer to you, he says, is to is to take a list of your top partners, and literally all we need is like 20 company names in their urls.\nWe'll hand it over to Rev. They'll provide us, and there's no charge for this.\nThe 2 outputs that I mentioned. They'll give us a list of these hexagraphics that are common to those companies. The one important note. There is, the larger the companies\nthe better the insights. And we've learned this the hard way, so you know, and then it has a lot to do with web presence. So the the larger the web presence the company has, the more information Rev. Can capture, so it preferably be\npartners on the upper tiers of where you guys kind of operate, and they'll also provide us\na sample list of lookalike companies from their database.\nAnd then, if we found the data compelling, and this is completely without obligation. We could then look at.\nmaybe acquiring data from Rev. They also have a lead generation platform which operates in a similar sort of content syndication\nmodel where you go to them and say, hey, i'll a\nX amount per lead, if you can find me. Other companies that look like these partners. So again the ask is.\ngive us a list of 20 companies. We'll come back to you with some data.\nno charge for doing so. The the ask in in from our side is, Tell us what you think\nis this: is this interesting? Is this useful? Could you use it?\nIs it compelling, is it? It doesn't really tell us anything we didn't already know?\nbut it's an exercise we'd love to.\nWe'd love to run.\nand I think that's it.\n \nAnila Baseel\n41:31\nHoward. Thank you for for reviewing this with us, and the answer to your questions is all the above.\nHowever, we do have already a vendor that we work with, and we we're working with the the vendor from a sales perspective, too, because they're connected there, so that you know the partners and lift. And we we do do all of these things that you're you're mentioning with them.\n \nHoward Sewell\n41:59\nSo okay\n \nAnila Baseel\n42:00\nappreciate the opportunity.\n \nHoward Sewell\n42:02\nYeah, absolutely. And I confess it again. It's a relatively new relationship\nfor us. We were excited about it because\nit allows us to kind of\nbring some technology to bear help. Refine the kind of work that we do. Everything that Sandy and Sri have been talking about content development email creative, you know targeting, etc. So we wanted to make it available to you. If frankly, if you want to do it, even as just a point of comparison.\nyou know, next to what you're getting from the other company. That is absolutely fine, but it's entirely your your.\nyour your option.\nSo\n \nAnila Baseel\n42:39\nthank you.\n \nHoward Sewell\n42:40\nYou're welcome\n \nSandi Settle\n42:42\nnext slide, please.\nSo we put together a quick action plan. Some ideas, maybe, for next steps for you and the team to take a look at and\nlet us know. You know you want us to move forward with this, but we're move we're in the development process. Sorry i'm a little tongue tied. we're in the development process for that with the cin 7 evoke\nso potentially it's As soon as that's completed we could write some blog articles on it to show how those like integrated solutions\nhelp, you know SMS and use that in the Newsletter in the resource center.\nwe could continue to work on some new industry specific topics to fill in the gaps in the resource center in the newsletter as well.\nAnother idea is to create a short script video script for that ebook as well to use in prom promotions\nto move forward with the survey questions for partners. And maybe in this case, if we don't do the survey, we could do a workshop where we could get more, you know in depth understanding\nof partner needs, but that\nthe idea here was to get ideas on their interests and topics for the office hours, webinars, but also new content pieces.\nAnalyze those survey results and suggest and some new topics for Webinars moving forward. So these are sort of like quick hits that we've identified.\nIs there anything there that you would like to add to, or anything like?\n \nAnila Baseel\n44:30\nJust a questions being that you can talk in a minute to get ready for the other for the next meeting.\nSo for the top of the funnel, content. These should be in the mark, the marketing service catalog, because initially, we had. We had helped the partners. Now we're saying, we need to Co. Invest. So\nif we don't have the video, and I'm. I'm forgetting, Louise. If we don't have the video or the blog article, or whatever from Sphere and Msc. Then we should probably add these, and that needs to be funneled through the marketing service catalogue.\n \nSandi Settle\n45:07\nGotcha. Yeah, okay.\nOn the next slide we wanted to show you. I believe it's the next slide. we wanted to show you\nsomething that we created using some of the initial data from the send 7 ebook process. We're still working on the ebook itself. But this is one example of what we can do with some of those data insights, and creating other pieces of contents that could extend the life of the campaigns, and this here is a infographic we'll provide the link to the sample right now. since Ivan has not seen this yet, either. So it's hot off the press. But this is\none exciting idea one way to visualize some of that data\nthat\nthat they provided as well.\nso our thought was to potentially, you know, turn this into a video or something as well. If the the client is interested, the prospect I have to jump off. But just 2 things. For example, one is, and we don't have to answer it on this call. One is that\n \nAnila Baseel\n46:15\nwe're trying to be out there in technology software? so how do we compete? And what are we not doing today that we could potentially look into right\nas next step for F 23. And the other is that I know Gina is amazing, and the teams really great. And you guys have been working amazingly. what else do you need from us? For me? From Gina, or anything that would make your lives a little bit easier other than content? what you know how. How else can we help you?\nbe more successful?\n \nSandi Settle\n46:48\nI think, understanding a little bit more about your overall goals for your you know your program itself and your slice of the business, I think, and understanding what you're trying to achieve for next year will help us.\nYou do do better.\ndo you have anything to add in here, Howard.\nunderstanding a little bit more about your lifetime goals, and how we measure success, you know, moving forward.\n \nHoward Sewell\n47:18\nYeah, I mean, it's always great to understand the larger goals and the grander objectives I would defer to you, Sandy, and the team being closer to the day to day than I am. But again it's it's a great\nrelationship, and one that is very collaborative, and a lot of information flowing back and forth. So\nyou know we are at this point. We are.\nyou know, and proving on\nthings that are\ngenerally working pretty well. So but we'll, you know we'll, we'll take that, you know. We'll take that request away and come back with ideas as well, so that's fair.\n \nGarrett Lawrence\n47:59\nGarrett. Did you have a question? No, i'm just gonna say, I mean, I agree anything as we learn about the specifics behind your goals and objectives that's really helpful, you know, if there's additional needs in terms of thought, leadership, and building your stature. If there's anything in customer, partner, advocacy you have, there's different things that we can contribute to. So happy to explore that and come back to you with some some thoughts.\n \nSandi Settle\n48:22\nThat's great. Thank you guys. I have to jump off, and this is really awesome. Thank you so much.\nGina Lexi. Do you have any questions?\n \nGina Madson\n48:34\nNo, i'm excited to see the ebook and the infographic, for some of them looks great, too, so that'll be great to have is the first one, and it sounds like march and edges back on track to move forward with theirs, too. So 2 of those up there to test in separate markets very different audiences. So right?\n \nSandi Settle\n48:52\nOkay, I think I have a last slide. Sorry, and this is just next steps.\nIf you could\nadvances side one more for me.\nI think next steps. Obviously, you know. Consider what's in here. We'll send you the Dac so we could develop a project plan, you know, moving forward. Some of the things we want to do is test some new vendors for the app marketplace campaign. we'd like to get approval\nan an understanding of what we're going to be moving forward with. We have a I think a straw man as to what kind of what our next\nquarter looks like, but maybe developing in the that plan out for Q. 4 2023, the April to June timeframe.\nwe will expedite the completion or we would like to expedite the completion of the ebook asset that your team is working on for content syndication.\nand we will share the infographic internally. And we're\nworking on the last touches for the ebook for cin 7 as well, and then potentially launching that partner survey or doing a workshop, whichever is best there. And if you discuss internally that you want to, you know, try out the Rev.\n \nHoward Sewell\n50:16\nOffer the insight, and i'm going to take an action item there, if I may, and that's too, because frankly, I don't know the answer to this is what makes them different, if at all, from in left.\nBecause I i'd i'd want to make sure that there's you know the differentiation and a value. Add there that would make even that exercise worthwhile. And so why Don't? Why, don't I find that out first, and then Gene and team we can. We can get back to you as to whether we still think that's maybe worth\nconsidering. So\n \nGina Madson\n50:52\nyeah, that'd be great. I'm curious to know myself. I'm sure there are some variations there, and\nI think a test would be fascinating. We just we've pulled back a little bit from our recruitment focus to emphasize more of our with partner marketing and activity. So I think that's maybe where there's a little hesitation to immediately jump in and test it. But yeah, and and again, just to be clear, I mean, this is just you know\n \nHoward Sewell\n51:17\nus running and running your customer list through their database, coming back with a few slides, and that's as far as it\nneeds to go. So it's basically just it's free data. But again, to the extent that you maybe are already getting all those insights.\nI just want to make sure it's worth even that amount of time, and that'll be on us to find out, and we'll get back to you.\n \nGina Madson\n51:37\nYeah, I mean, we do have a within. Let's not just quickly say, but we are still struggling to target effectively. We want to recruit into our program. So if there could be deeper levels of insight or takeaways or insight, you know, period information is generally helpful. So\n \nHoward Sewell\n51:55\nI I would love to test it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's great. Well, let me. Let me find out what the differences are, and then we can. We can. We can well work with Sandy and team, and we can talk about what the next steps might be.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n52:08\nSounds good.\n \nSandi Settle\n52:10\nWell, thanks, everybody, for the time we'll see you in a few minutes. I'm gonna take a quick break, and then we'll jump on the other. The other call.\n \nLynn Dodds\n52:18\nI don't think I am.\n \n\n\n Save & SubmitCancel"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Here is some text. Can you analyze claims about social problems in it?\n\nOur main story tonight concerns crime — y’know: McGruff’s kink. It’s genuinely impressive this crime dog taught a whole generation how to be narcs while simultaneously dressing like he’s about to jerk it in the back of a movie theater. Specifically, we’re going to talk about how crime is covered by the news. Because the news loves covering crime — sometimes seriously, and sometimes like this.\n\nLet’s get this straight from the start: you’re Nedra Brantley, right?\n\nI am.\n\nIs your name Mike?\n\nNo, it’s not.\n\nThis is what Nedra’s car looked like today. “Mike is a cheater” spray painted all over it. Cheater, cheater, Mike is a cheater. Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, see what you’ve done? I don’t know who you are. I don’t know where you are. But you may want to start changing your ways — or changing your name.\n\nJohn: Yes. I want that man on my tv all day every day. In fact, if you sent NBC4 Washington’s Pat Collins to Ukraine, I’d guarantee it’d be sorted out tomorrow. “Vlad Vlad Vlad Vlad Vlad — see what you’ve done?!” You’ve undoubtedly noticed that crime makes up a significant part of your local news’s programming. But the scale of that coverage has a real impact. Research has shown that viewing local tv news is related to increased fear of, and concern about crime, and that tv news viewers are also more likely to support tougher crime policies. Which does help explain why our perceptions of crime can be sharply at odds with the reality of it. For over thirty years, Gallup has asked Americans whether they think the U.S. has more or less crime compared to the year before, and in in every year but one, even as the actual crime rate has plummeted. Interestingly, the one year a majority said “less” was 2001. Famously a year where everything was super chill, no drama, just vibes. Tv news leans hard on “this could happen to you” crime stories, which are designed to pull you in — with the latest version being this.\n\nAuthorities continue to sound the alarm about the dangers of rainbow fentanyl.\n\nAnother warning about rainbow fentanyl — the deadly drug disguised as candy!\n\nIt is called rainbow fentanyl. The colorful candy-like appearance is actually designed to appeal to young kids.\n\nThey’re attractive, they’re colorful, they look like candy.\n\nThis is every parent’s worst nightmare. Especially in the month of October, as Halloween fast approaches. This is treacherous deception to market rainbow fentanyl like candy.\n\nJohn: Okay so, first, rainbow fentanyl sounds like the title of a very special episode of “My Little Pony.” But second, while the idea of it being made to target kids sounds scary, experts on narcotics have pointed out: those pills are almost certainly colored just to differentiate products, and it has nothing to do with marketing to kids at all, period, whatsoever. Which does makes sense, because kids — and this is true — not an ideal customer base for expensive street drugs. Because even if dealers were targeting trick-or-treaters with a “first one’s on the house” strategy, where do you expect little Zeke to come up with the cash for the next one? Sure, he’s got his weekly allowance, but he smacked his brother yesterday, so that’s that dollar gone. And the rest of his net worth is tied up in Lego store gift cards. He’s useless to dealers. Maybe check back in ten years when he gets prescribed oxy after a lacrosse injury. And look, that’s not to say that opioid addiction among young people isn’t a real issue — it obviously is. But it doesn’t help the conversation around that issue, to have newscasters jumping on splashy “your kid’s Halloween candy could be fentanyl” stories that even in this report, they half-acknowledge is bullshit, right at the very end.\n\nPolice departments are warning parents to check the candy their kids bring home from trick or treating.\n\nWe don’t want to have kids who are taking pills that they think is candy and is really not.\n\nThere have been no instances of that happening.\n\nJohn: Yeah, of course not. I’m so glad you tacked that disclaimer on at the end there. I’m sure the three second debunk read over the station logo is exactly what everyone’s going to take away from that report, and definitely not the images of little hulks sticking their hands into bowls of skittle-shaped smack. But that instinct to run an eye-catching crime story without being skeptical of its sourcing is unfortunately incredibly common. So given that, tonight, let’s talk about crime reporting — specifically, the incentives driving the outlets that cover crime, the flawed sources they rely upon, and the greater harm it can do to all of us. And let’s start with the obvious here — crime has always driven ratings. The mantra “if it bleeds, it leads” has been around for decades. But the philosophy really took hold around the 1970s, when two local stations in Philadelphia pioneered the “eyewitness” and “action news” formats, which leaned heavily on crime news. As one anchor there explained, “crime was cheap to cover. It was easy to cover. The assignment desk said to the cameraman, ‘you shoot the scene, you shoot the blood, you shoot victims, whatever they got. And you can do it in 20 seconds.'” But that isn’t good. The most meaningful stories are rarely the fastest or the cheapest. And I’m not just saying that because I host “very long news stories that are also expensive to produce: the comedy show,” I’m saying it because it’s true. Nonetheless, those formats quickly spread to 200 markets around the country. And by the 1990s, CNN even did a whole piece wondering if all that crime coverage was necessarily a good thing.\n\nCrime news can look a lot like entertainment.\n\nThe dark black is crime coverage.\n\nOne Los Angeles station, a study shows, spent over half its newscasts on crime. Others came close.\n\nI’m convinced that if you could get everyone who wanted to commit suicide to do it on — in a public place where the media could be present, we would have like a tv show called “suicide today.”\n\nJohn: Wow, way to bring down the room. But not to step on that man’s creative pursuits, but there’s already primetime programming where people kill themselves for our entertainment — it’s called Monday night football. Happy concussion season football fans! It sure feels like this sport maybe shouldn’t exist! So people have been raising the alarm about our obsession with crime news for a while. But it’s clearly been hard for news outlets to give it up. As they’re constantly making space for stories about crimes — be they major or incredibly minor — often illustrated with mugshots. The “New York Daily News” even has mugshot galleries on their website right now, with titles like, “criminally bad hair days.” And “babes behind bars.” It’s fun, isn’t it? It’s fun, because it’s their worst day. And the thing is, the faces that get shown can compound existing inequities in our justice system. A study a few years ago here in New York found that, while around a quarter of the city’s population is black, black people made up half of all arrests and three-quarters of criminals shown on the news. Which is clearly going to distort public perception. And while outlets may justify reporting on sensational arrests as “part of the public interest”, far too often — whether due to a lack of time, or resources, or inclination — they don’t follow up on what the outcomes of those cases are. Which can seriously impact people’s lives. Take Darcell Trotter — he and his brother were accused of sexual assault in 2012, by a woman who not only recanted her accusations, but pled guilty to filing a false police report. The problem is, their charges had already made the local news, which then never got around to mentioning the charges were dismissed. And years later, with uncorrected stories still sitting on news sites, Darcell was having to make calls like these.\n\nHow you doing, Jim? My name is Darcell Trotter and it was an article regarding of accused of — being accused of sexual assault, me, my twin brother.\n\nDid we do a story where the charges were dropped too?\n\nNo, you guys never did that.\n\nWe should’ve had a follow-up story that charges were dropped.\n\nYeah, I mean, that would have been nice.\n\nJohn: Yeah, it would’ve been! And if I could just talk to the “Jim” there for a second: hey Jim — I don’t know if that’s short for James, Jimothy, or Jimiroquai. But either way, Jim? Your paper goofed! You can’t just report the start of a story and ignore the end. Imagine if the news hadn’t covered the end of balloon boy. Oh, well! Guess he’s still up there! The balloon has left my immediate line of vision, so, who really gives a shit! So the news media can be overly reliant on eye-catching crime stories that are quick and easy to turn around. And the speed with which the daily crime beat operates actually leads to one of the biggest issues in crime coverage, which is that it often relies heavily on a single source. It’s why, if you watch tv news for any length of time, you’ll undoubtedly hear one particular phrase.\n\nThe Lovington police say they know who was responsible for a prank at a local park.\n\nPolice in Fairfield say an officer was attacked with bear spray.\n\nPolice say no suspects are in custody.\n\nPolice say —\n\nPolice say —\n\nPolice say —\n\nPolice say —\n\nPolice say —\n\nPolice say —\n\nJohn: Yeah, “police say” is a phrase you constantly hear from the mouths of news reporters. It’s right up there with, “this just in,” or “back to you,” or “I apologize for the accent I did on cinco de mayo.” And look, there’s obviously nothing wrong with calling the police to ask questions. When you’re working on a deadline, you can’t always reach arrested civilians or their attorneys, who sometimes don’t want to talk with you anyway. And police can be easy to reach — many larger departments have even set up robust media-relations divisions. The la county sheriff’s department has 42 people in its information bureau, at an annual cost of $4.8 million, and the LAPD spends over $3 million for 25 people in similar units. Which is already telling. Because while a certain amount of spending is necessary, you don’t spend that much on PR if things are going “great.” For context, all those budgets combined equal just one month’s salary for Ezra Miller’s publicist. They are so tired. They need to sleep. Even smaller police departments can have Public Information Officers, or PIO’s, and as this one proudly notes, his press releases can make it straight to air.\n\nSomething major happens, whether it’s a shooting or some major car accident, whatever it is. You go back to your office. You type up this long press release, and you send it out to the public and all the news agencies. Within minutes, you have reporters from all over the country calling you. There’s something strangely satisfying that when you put out that press release, hours later, you’re watching the news, and every station that’s talking about your story is literally reading your press release word for word.\n\nJohn: Set aside the fact that everything about this man answers the question “what if Fred Durst but worse?” That claim that the police’s versions of events can be parroted verbatim in the press is genuinely alarming. Although I can’t really fault him for being excited at seeing his work read word for word on tv. Ask my writers and they’ll tell you they experience the same thrill whenever I read one of their little jizz jokes. Their parents couldn’t be prouder. Hey, chrissy, did you like hearing me say your McGruff Dog jerking it joke, I bet you did you college graduate? But the fact reporters will echo PIO’s does explain certain things — like the ubiquity of phrases like “officer-involved shooting.” You see it in police accounts all the time, but it’s a weird term for reporters to repeat, because it deliberately omits crucial information about how the officer was involved. If you went to someone’s house for dinner and they said “tonight, there is a rat-involved dinner,” you’d justifiably have follow up questions. Are we going to a chuck e. Cheese? Is the chef being controlled by a tiny French rat under his hat? Or are we going to be on an episode of “kitchen nightmares?” All three are technically “rat-involved”, but some options are easier to live with than others. And honestly, police departments don’t always need a PIO to push their narrative, as outlets will sometimes just grab shit from a law-enforcement agency’s social media. For instance, police love posting evidence from busts they’ve conducted like this one, which a Texas news station not only shared on their own Facebook page, but even included on their evening broadcast.\n\nA search warrant executed Monday has left three people behind bars. The Tenaha police department has released information on the raid.\n\nAmong the items seized were two pounds of marijuana, illegally possessed prescription pills, drug paraphernalia, packaging materials, guns, and cash.\n\nJohn: Now, if you don’t really think about what you’re looking at there, I guess that seems like a story. But is it? Because, as many quickly pointed out, when you examine the photo, you realize, not only is that not a lot of drugs, there’s way less cash there than they’re going out of their way to make it look. Most of those are singles. That’s $70, total. One commenter on the station’s post said, “sick. This is Playskool’s my first dealer set,” with another adding, “who was the drug dealer, el cheapo?” And that speaks to the fact there can be a gap — sometimes small, but sometimes massive — between “the story police are telling everyone” and “the story that actually happened.” Because cops’ stories can, for a lot of reasons, turn out to be wrong, in ways both serious, and incredibly petty. Take the trend of cops claiming mistreatment at the hands of fast-food employees, which local news can be only happy to gobble right up.\n\nA possible hate crime against police is being investigated right now at a Shake Shack in downtown Manhattan. Sources tell CBS 2, three officers became sick after having shakes from the restaurant tonight. Police suspect an employee may have contaminated the drinks with bleach.\n\nThe Layton police sergeant ordered a sub and a lemonade from this Subway. But after taking a few sips of his drink, he quickly found out he got much more than what he paid for.\n\nHe was having a hard time maintaining his body. His body was jerking.\n\nWhat caused those side effects, police say, turned out to be a double dose of illegal narcotics.\n\nDJ, a local law enforcement officer told eyewitness news he suspects someone at McDonald’s took a bite from his sandwich before he completed the sale.\n\nTonight a McDonald’s in junction city is investigating after a police officer found insulting words written on his coffee. The F-word has been blurred out in this image of course but, you can see the word pig written right below it.\n\nJohn: Okay, there’s a lot there, but real quick: there was no bleach in the shakes, no drugs in the lemonade, the cop with the sandwich later admitted he’d simply forgotten he took a bite from it, and the one with the coffee admitted he’d written “fucking pig” on his own cup. Which is a serious act of self-loathing, unless you’re miss piggy, in which case it’s a slay. Outta the way boys, she’s got fashion to werk and frog dick to slurp. Who’s coffee is that? It’s this fucking pig’s. And that speaks to one of the major problems with deferring to police. Because — as many of you have undoubtedly been yelling at your tv, like I’m a wheel of fortune contestant who can’t solve the puzzle — police lie, and they lie a lot. As you’ve seen on this show, they’ve lied to get search warrants to conduct raids and to get confessions during interrogations, and they even lie under oath — so often that, here in New York, it came to be known as “testilying.” All of which should be more than enough for “the word of the police” to be treated with immense skepticism, rather than repeated verbatim. Take the notorious press release Minneapolis police put out following the murder of George Floyd titled “Man dies after medical incident during police interaction.” What you may not know is, it was picked up almost word for word by local news the next morning.\n\nWe do begin this morning with developing news. A man is dead after what police are calling a medical distress after being handcuffed. Now, officers were responding to a forgery in progress. It happened on the 3700 block of Chicago Avenue South. When they arrived, officers found a man they believed to be the suspect sitting inside a car. They apparently told him to get out. He resisted. Officers eventually got him handcuffed, which is when he appeared to have the medical issue. The suspect was taken to the hospital, where he died a short time later.\n\nJohn: Now, obviously, that’s a hugely self-serving statement from the police. Because by saying “George Floyd died because of medical distress,” their role was completely erased. His “medical distress” — and I’m using the biggest air quotes humanly possible — was the result of an officer pressing his knee into his neck for nine minutes. Repeating that claim by the police is an act of malpractice akin to Walter Cronkite saying, “JFK died of a headache today.” Sure, it’s not “technically” wrong, but it’s the understatement of the fucking century. The point is, it was only after the release of cell phone footage recorded by a brave seventeen year old girl, that that police narrative fell apart. Otherwise, that bullshit press release might well have been the version of events that everybody heard. And that’s not a one-off. An investigation last year of police killings in California, found at least a dozen examples of initial police statements misrepresenting events, with reports citing “vague medical emergencies without disclosing that officers had caused the emergencies through their use of force.” And “in most instances, media outlets repeated the police version of events with little skepticism.” Which isn’t good! There’s a time and a place for media outlets to operate without skepticism, and it’s the cover of health magazines — not an ounce of critical thinking on this extremely real cover that includes the headlines “Lose 9 waist inches in 21 days” and “News! A potato a day ups weight loss by 340%!” That’s rock solid science, presumably! And there are times where the trust reporters place in some police sources has been particularly egregious. Just take what happened in Chicago, after the police shot teenager Laquan McDonald sixteen times. In their initial coverage, multiple local outlets featured interviews with one person on the scene, whose version of events heavily favored the police.\n\nI don’t know what his mental state was, but he wasn’t dropping the knife and he was coming at the officer. You obviously aren’t going to sit down and have a cup of coffee with him. He is a very serious threat to the officers, and he leaves them no choice at that point but to defend themselves.\n\nJohn: Well, that’s a very detailed picture painted by palm beach potato head there, but a few things: first, while he sounds like an eyewitness, he wasn’t there. Second, videotape later revealed that the story he was telling was complete horseshit — police shot MacDonald when he was walking away from them. But finally, reporters should’ve known to take anything that guy said with a massive grain of salt, because Pat Camden is the spokesperson for the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, which functions as part police union, part special interest lobby group. His only agenda is to protect cops. And it was way too easy for this lil mustachio’d weirdo to hear there was a shooting, drive to the scene, jump in front of cameras and grab control of the narrative. And Camden does this a lot — one analysis found that in a four-year timespan, he provided an initial version of events for 35 police shootings. And in 15 cases, crucial aspects of his statements were later proved to be false or misleading. Which is just wild. If you get caught cheating at one casino, they ban you from every casino. This guy’s peddled bullshit to the press 15 times, yet somehow his picture isn’t pinned behind every news desk in the country, with the warning “do not ask this man about anything.” So, so, so often, it seems like news outlets would be serving their communities much better if they weren’t quite so trusting when it came to what police tell them. To see a lot of what I’ve talked about tonight in one place, take what happened in Brookside, Alabama, where a few years ago, local news was excitedly reporting on a new initiative from their police department, which “police said” was getting real results.\n\nWe tell you stories all the time about crime going up, but we got some good news: the town of Brookside says they’re seeing crime go down.\n\nBrookside is not a big town, but its narcotics interdiction team? They’ve been busy.\n\nAnother drug bust this weekend on i-22.\n\nAnd the Brookside police have been so busy.\n\nOur number one goal is to not prosecute people. It’s to save lives. That’s why we got into this. We want to save lives. We want to keep our citizens safe. We want to keep people who are coming to Brookside safe and enjoy our town.\n\nJohn: All that coverage is just so weird. It’s part local news fluff, part propaganda, and something bordering on a tourism ad from officer Teddy Ruxpin there. But think about it, it’s a bit strange that one tiny town in Alabama had suddenly become a hotbed for drug smuggling, right? Well, it turns out, yes. And I will say, to its credit, one local station did dig a little deeper, airing a report about the fact a weird amount of drivers were questioning the tickets written by that police department. A story, incidentally, that led that department to tell employees that anyone talking to that reporter would be fired. But it wasn’t until two years later that an in-depth investigation from al.com revealed what had actually been happening, that is that Brookside — a town of just 1,200 people — was having its finances rocket-fueled by tickets and aggressive policing, with bullshit traffic tickets being issued at a truly ridiculous rate.\n\nBrookside dragged so many people into court that police had to direct traffic on court days. Money from fines and forfeiture soared more than 600% to the point where it made up half the town budget.\n\nJohn: It’s true. It got to the point where the police department was taking in $487 for every man, woman and child, and spending it on, among other things, a swat team, a jail, a fleet of unmarked cars, and two drug-sniffing dogs — one of which they named, and this is true, k-9 cash. Here is that dog. And I will say, he does look like a k-9 cash. And that’s not a compliment. Bad dog. But the point is, what was actually happening in Brookside turned out to be a pretty far cry from the initial coverage of, “hey, great news, this small town police force is apparently Miami Vice all of a sudden. Anyway, no further questions.” And the thing is, by presenting police uncritically, you’re not just helping them dodge accountability — you’re giving them a huge lobbying platform. Right now, you don’t have to look far to find cops on tv, suggesting the fix for any rise in crime is to undo the criminal justice reforms of the past few years, and to give them more money. And this can get real results. Even the current rainbow fentanyl scare started with a DEA press release, which happened to drop just as congress was in the midst of budget negotiations. Everyone picked up that story, and what do you know, last week, Chuck Schumer announced his intention to allocate nearly 300 million more dollars to law enforcement, so they can fight the scourge of rainbow fentanyl. And look, I’m not saying all crime reporting is bad. There’s some incredible coverage out there. We feature it on this show all the time, and a lot of what I told you tonight, came from great investigative reporting. But the daily crime beat, whether from lack of resources, lack of scrutiny, or lack of follow-through, far too often, takes police at their word, and not as an interest group who should be treated as such. So, what should happen here? Well, the police could change the ways they both behave and communicate. But given that’s not going to happen anytime soon, it unfortunately falls to the rest of us. For news outlets, they could try and snap out of their automatic deference to police. Which is actually possible — just watch what happened when a political web series from the hill invited on a public defender to discuss the case of Jayland Walker, who was killed by police after fleeing a traffic stop. Watch her push back when the host seems a little too eager to accept the police line.\n\nThere’s no world, no traffic infraction, the punishment is death, not a one, never. So there’s no reason why eight officers should choose to go and shoot him to death.\n\nI — I guess I — I just don’t have a lot of sympathy in this particular case, although I do —\n\nYou don’t have a lot of sympathy in this case where he was shot 60 times?\n\nAfter fle — after leading the police on a high-speed chase and returning fire?\n\nFirst of all, let me just say this, the police, no, let’s — let’s — because too often media reports on what are police stories as though it is the ultimate truth. We see too many, too many discrepancies for us to cons — consistently lean on what the police say is the truth.\n\nAbsolutely, I agree.\n\nPolice say, which has not yet been substantiated or corroborated — they say they believe that one bullet might have come from the window. They said — that’s what the say. Their argument is maybe —\n\nRight, who knows if that’s true?\n\nExactly. But what I do know is that they shot this boy 60 times for a traffic infraction, I know that, so.\n\nAll right, we’ll have our rising panel join us next.\n\nJohn: That is amazing. If for nothing else than to watch baby Ryan Seacrest try to wrap up the segment after getting his ass absolutely handed to him. But while it’s incredible to watch him, in real time, backtrack from “I don’t have a lot of sympathy” to “absolutely, I agree, who knows what’s true?,” It shouldn’t be incumbent on that woman to walk him to that point. She can’t be on every local news set. She has a life to live. And there are small changes that might help reorient all of our thinking. Some experts have suggested that, rather than going with “police say,” outlets should consider going with “police claim,” instead which seems like a good start. And to be fair, some outlets are looking at other changes. Some, like the “USA Today” network, have stopped publishing mug shot galleries, saying they feed into negative stereotypes and are of limited news value. Which they are. And “The Arizona Republic” has pledged it will follow any case it covers to its conclusion, in courts or otherwise. Which hopefully will save people like Darcell Trotter from having to make phone calls like the incredibly restrained one that you saw him make earlier. But the larger cultural change might be for outlets to fundamentally reconsider whether the crimes they’re covering are actually newsworthy. Because the truth is, not all crimes are. And crime is only one small slice of the much bigger picture they could be painting of what’s happening in communities. The fact is, because crime news is pumped at us 24/7, the way it’s reported is deeply linked with how it’s both perceived by the public, and prosecuted by the state. And look, we’ve said before, local news is incredibly important, which is why it’s critical that it’s done well. So to the outlets who do put an undue amount of weight on police statements and prioritize sensational crime coverage over complete pictures of public safety, if I may, I’d like to throw it over to one of your own."}]}

The enforcers of “zero-covid” are nowhere to be found. In China’s battle against covid-19, the state has disappeared from the front lines. For nearly three years President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a “people’s war”. Now he has surrendered and the people must live with the enemy.\n\n\tListen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.\n\n\tMr Xi is not the first leader to conclude that such a fight was unwinnable. But before ditching their zero-covid policies, other countries first took pains to administer vaccines, stockpile antiviral drugs and draw up treatment guidelines. China had ample time to do all of that. Yet more than two years after the first vaccine proved effective, the country remains ill-prepared. That has made opening up much more dangerous than it ought to be.\n\n\tHow dangerous? In this week’s China section we publish our model of how the epidemic might play out. It comes with essential caveats. Modelling an epidemic is difficult. Modelling one in China, where the data are often unreliable, is even harder. We take into account variables such as vaccination rates, the effectiveness of Chinese jabs, the lethality of covid for different age groups and the number of intensive-care beds. In a worst case, if covid spreads freely and many people cannot get care, we estimate that in the coming months 1.5m Chinese people will die from the virus.\n\n\tAlthough that is a lower share of the population than in many rich countries, it is still a criticism of the government’s poor preparations. It is also a call to action. A vaccination drive will take months. The government has waited too long to build and staff new icus. But even if the state will not impose lockdowns while it prepares, it can mitigate the number of deaths.\n\n\tIt should start by protecting the health system. A wave of covid is breaking over China. Our model sees this peaking in January. By that time hospitals risk being overwhelmed. Beds and staff are a precious resource to be husbanded. That means keeping people who are not seriously ill away from hospitals. To that end, the state could help drug companies restock pharmacies that run out of such things as lateral-flow tests and paracetamol. Medical staff should be vaccinated first and they must be given the proper gear to minimise the risk of infection.\n\n\tA second step is to ensure cheap and plentiful supplies of covid drugs. Dexamethasone, a low-priced steroid, has been shown to reduce deaths among the most severely ill patients. Antivirals, such as Paxlovid, help keep those most at risk out of hospital. These drugs have become part of the toolkit doctors around the world are using to fight the virus. They could save many thousands of lives in China. Only the government knows if it has enough of them to go around. If not, it should start stocking up. Foreign governments would surely send supplies if China asked. President Xi Jinping should not let his pride imperil China’s people, as he has done by shunning more efficacious Western vaccines.\n\n\tChina’s vaccines still work. So the third priority is to get them into people’s arms. It may be too late for many in this wave, but there will be others. Less than half of those over 80 years old have had three shots, the number needed for decent protection against severe disease and death. Yet some of the elderly have gone to the clinic for a jab only to be turned away for lack of supplies. Until recently, some vaccine factories were sitting idle. Vast quantities will be needed. Six-monthly booster shots ought to become a normal part of life for older Chinese.\n\n\tAs the state has failed to do its job, people are helping themselves. Masks are ubiquitous in many cities and more people are working from home. Restaurants and cinemas may be open, but in cities such as Beijing they remain largely empty. All this will help slow the growth of this covid wave and ease the pressure on hospitals. But the government must also act. In a country the size of China, even small steps could save many lives.\"  \n\n\n\tFrom the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting:\n\n\n\t\t1. \"President Xi Jinping tried to contain the virus, calling his efforts a “people’s war”\"\n\t\t2. \"A wave of covid is breaking over China. Our model sees this peaking in January.\"\n\t\t3. \"we estimate that in the coming months 1.5m Chinese people will die from the virus\"\n\t\t4. \"To that end, the state could help drug companies restock pharmacies that run out of such things as lateral-flow tests and paracetamol\"\n\t\t5. \"A second step is to ensure cheap and plentiful supplies of covid drugs.

So the third priority is to get them into people’s arms.\"\n\n\t  \nArticle:\n\n\t\"How Chinese people are dealing with the spread of covid-19\n\n\tThe government has left the public to fend for itself\n\n\tA elderly man wearing a face mask and goggle walks on a street in Beijing, Sunday, Dec. 11, 2022. Facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, China is setting up more intensive care facilities and trying to strengthen hospitals as Beijing rolls back anti-virus controls that confined millions of people to their homes, crushed economic growth and set off protests.\n\n\tJust a few months ago Chinese people had little fear of catching covid-19. The government’s “zero-covid” measures kept them safe for the most part. Mass testing and strict lockdowns contained the virus. If a person did test positive, the government would swoop in. The infected were taken to state-run quarantine centres. If symptomatic, they were treated in a designated hospital. Health workers would douse their house with disinfectant and test their neighbours.\n\n\tAll this changed on December 7th, when the central government largely ditched its zero-covid policy, lifting most restrictions. Six days later it scrapped an app that tracked people’s movements. The highly transmissible Omicron variant had made zero-covid unsustainable.\n\n\tNow the public is expected to fend for itself. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” wrote the People’s Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece. Some residents of Beijing have received letters from the local committees that used to enforce covid controls. Stop reporting fevers and coughs to us, one read, before wishing people good luck. “Thank you for the past three years of support and understanding.”\n\n\tThe official number of new cases is falling, as if the virus were fading away. But official numbers are no longer reliable because the government has scaled back testing. If it has an alternative way of keeping tabs on the epidemic, it is not sharing it.\n\n\tStill, it is pretty clear that a covid wave is building, as people share stories of infection online. An informal survey has been circulating on social media asking Beijing residents if they have caught the virus. As The Economist went to press, 39% of the 434,000 or so respondents had said yes.\n\n\tSuch surveys are striking, not just for the numbers. A few months ago people who had caught covid were stigmatised. They might, for example, struggle to find jobs after recovering. Now the disease is so common that people are posting their test results on social media, often substituting for the word “positive” a cartoon of a sheep (which is a Chinese homophone for positive). Others are sharing lighthearted advice about the best time to catch covid. An infection now or in early January, for example, might clear up in time for a person to enjoy both Christmas and the lunar new year. “Why aren’t I positive yet?” complained one young woman in a video.\n\n\tOthers, though, are worried. Until recently the government told people that covid was to be feared. Now the official line is that Omicron is no worse than the flu. Infected people who are not showing serious symptoms have been encouraged to stay at home and treat themselves. Not everyone is listening. Beijing’s emergency-call operators have been swamped by over 30,000 calls a day, about six times the average. Queues have appeared outside fever clinics in several cities. Certain medicines are in short supply. On December 13th a health-care website began selling Paxlovid, a highly effective antiviral drug used to treat covid. Its initial stocks sold out in half an hour.\n\n\tHospitals are under more stress as doctors and nurses catch the virus. There are reports that some medical workers who have tested positive have been asked to come in anyway, risking more transmission within hospitals. As of December 13th Beijing had 50 severely ill patients, according to the official numbers. So far, the health system does not appear to be overwhelmed. But the peak of this wave is still some way off. It will probably come in late January, at least in Beijing, says Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong.\n\n\tWith the government changing its message, people are looking elsewhere for guidance. Overseas Chinese students who have experience with covid are sharing advice on WeChat, a social-media app. They tell people what symptoms to expect and how long they might last. In general, though, good information on the virus is lacking. There are reports of people going to hospital after taking too much fever medicine. Herbal remedies used to combat covid are in hot demand, though doctors doubt their effectiveness.\n\n\tVaccines, not voodoo\n\n\tAt least people now see the need to protect themselves against the virus, which was once viewed as a terrifying but distant threat. More are getting vaccinated. The number of jabs administered each day has increased from fewer than 200,000 to over 1m. But there is a lot of ground to make up, especially when it comes to the most vulnerable. Only around 40% of people over 80 have received the three doses needed to significantly reduce the chances of severe disease or death. Yet some elderly people have had trouble getting a shot because of a lack of supply at clinics.\n\n\tPeople are also taking steps that will help mitigate the spread of the disease and perhaps reduce the pressure on hospitals. In Beijing the shopping centres and streets are largely empty, as people stay inside. Call it a self-imposed lockdown. People who do venture out wear n95 masks (which are good at filtering small airborne particles). Demand for home deliveries of meals and groceries has shot up.\n\n\tBut people are still making plans to travel back to their villages and home towns for the lunar new year in late January. Data from Ctrip, a booking platform, show that the volume of searches for flights has increased by 160% since the government loosened restrictions. Searches for train tickets on Baidu, a search engine, increased by nearly 600% during that time. Many rural areas are woefully unprepared to handle a surge in cases.\n\n\tWhen the peak of this wave approaches, “it would make a lot of sense to bring back some public-health measures,” says Mr Cowling. But reversing course may be hard for the government to justify without admitting that it had made a mistake.\"\n\n\t  \nFrom the article above, I find the following sentences most interesting:\n\n\n\t\t1. \"lifting most restrictions. Six days later it scrapped an app that tracked people’s movements\"\n\t\t2. \"Now the public is expected to fend for itself. “Be the first person responsible for your own health,” wrote the People’s Daily\"\n\t\t3. \"But official numbers are no longer reliable because the government has scaled back testing\"\n\t\t4. \"A few months ago people who had caught covid were stigmatised. They might, for example, struggle to find jobs after recovering.\"\n\t\t5. \"Beijing’s emergency-call operators have been swamped by over 30,000\"\n\n\t  \nArticle:\n\n\t\"China pushes vaccines as retreat from 'zero-COVID' turns messy.\n\n\tBeijing urges inoculations for elderly\n\n\tWHO calls for vaccine drive as virus spreads\n\n\tEconomic summit starts amid more dire data\n\n\tBEIJING/SHANGHAI, Dec 15 (Reuters) - China raced to vaccinate its most vulnerable people on Thursday in anticipation of waves of COVID-19 infections, with some analysts expecting the death toll to soar after it eased strict controls that had kept the pandemic at bay for three years.\n\n\tThe push comes as the World Health Organisation also raised concerns that China's 1.4 billion population was not adequately vaccinated and the United States offered help in dealing with a surge in infections.\n\n\tBeijing last Wednesday began dismantling its tough 'zero-COVID' controls, dropping testing requirements and easing quarantine rules that had caused anxiety for tens of millions and battered the world's second largest economy.\n\n\tThe pivot away from President Xi Jinping's signature \"zero-COVID\" policy followed unprecedented widespread protests against it. But, WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan said infections were exploding in China well before the government's decision to phase out its stringent regime.\n\n\t\"There's a narrative at the moment that China lifted the restrictions and all of a sudden the disease is out of control,\" Ryan told a briefing in Geneva.\n\n\t\"The disease was spreading intensively because I believe the control measures in themselves were not stopping the disease.\"\n\n\tChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Thursday China has \"institutional advantages\" to fight COVID.\n\n\t\"We will certainly be able to smoothly get through the peak of the epidemic,\" he told a regular news briefing in response to White House national security spokesperson John Kirby saying that the United States was ready to help if China requested it.\n\n\tThere are increasing signs of chaos during China's change of tack - including long queues outside fever clinics, runs on medicines and panic buying across the country.\n\n\tOn Thursday night, China's state asset regulator urged state-backed big drugmakers to ensure supplies of COVID-related medicines.\n\n\tThe companies include China Resources, China General Technology and Sinopharm, which own businesses that produce drugs that could ease coronavirus symptoms.\n\n\tOne video posted online on Wednesday showed several people in thick winter clothes hooked up to intravenous drips as they sat on stools on the street outside a clinic in central Hubei province. Reuters verified the location of the video.\n\n\tThe COVID scare in China also led people in Hong Kong, Macau and in some neighbourhoods in Australia to go in search for fever medicines and test kits for family and friends on the mainland.\n\n\tFor all its efforts to quell the virus since it erupted in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, China may now pay a price for shielding a population that lacks \"herd immunity\" and has low vaccination rates among the elderly, analysts said.\n\n\t\"Authorities have let cases in Beijing and other cities spread to the point where resuming restrictions, testing and tracing would be largely ineffective in bringing outbreaks under control,\" analysts at Eurasia Group said in a note on Thursday.\n\n\t\"Upward of 1 million people could die from COVID in the coming months.\"\n\n\tOther experts have put the potential toll at more than 2 million. China has reported just 5,235 COVID-related deaths so far, extremely low by global standards.\n\n\tChina's stock markets and its currency fell on Thursday on concerns of the virus spread.\n\n\tChina reported 2,000 new symptomatic COVID-19 infections for Dec. 14 compared with 2,291 a day. The official figures, however, have become less reliable as testing has dropped. It also stopped reporting asymptomatic figures on Wednesday.\n\n\tCONCERN FOR ELDERLY\n\n\tChina, which has said around 90% of its population is vaccinated against COVID, has now decided to roll out the second booster shot for high-risk groups and elderly people over 60 years of age.\n\n\tNational Health Commission spokesperson Mi Feng said on Wednesday it was necessary to accelerate the promotion of vaccinations, according to comments reported by state media.\n\n\tThe latest official data shows China administered 1.43 million COVID shots on Tuesday, well above rates in November of around 100,000-200,000 doses a day. In total, it has administered 3.45 billion shots.\n\n\tVaccinations in China have been ramping up in recent days.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "3 / 3\"Organize this transcript into a detailed status report; listing all people on the call, any topics discussed and sub bullets of action items raised, thoughts, comments, concerns and opportunities moving forward.\"\nThis report should be a resource for anyone to read and understand what the key points were.\n\n\n \nShirin Safavy\n00:34\nso as far as our agenda for today i'll walk us through\nour goals and objectives. From this past year\ni'll cover an executive summary our accomplishments together.\nand then we'll talk through campaign performance.\nand Sandy will take over from there and walk through some insights and learnings, and\nwe'll wrap up with opportunities and next steps.\nSo our biggest goal for 2022 was to create awareness of the Qsp Partner program\nspecifically talking to the Isv.\nAnd Msp audiences, which was something that has not been done before\n \nShirin Safavy\n01:51\nSo our end goal\nfor this year was to increase partner sales of the cute\nquickbook solutions.\nwe also wanted to create some educational opportunities for partners so that they could more effectively market and sell these solutions, especially the quick books online solution.\nAnd i'm not gonna read through everything. There's a lot to talk through today. So if there's something you see on here that we didn't cover\nfeel free to ask about that\nlater in the meeting.\nSo in 2,022, we provided over 5,700 new leads we did this by developing and launching lead Gen. Programs for partner recruitment\nand through partner marketing\nwe managed a total of 16 webinars, including the execution\nwhich freed up a lot of time for Gina and her team.\nWe hosted and developed marketing best practices content, and we did this\nfor 7 monthly meet the expert series.\nand we also refined the Isv. And msp messaging, so that we can better address the needs of those audiences.\nSo what did we accomplish?\nI just mentioned that we generated over 5,700 leads.\nhere's how they break down. So 3 300 of those were generated for Isv.\nMs. P. For the partner recruitment.\nand a little over 2,400 leads were through Webinar registrations\nand Content Syndication programs.\nWe also created a newsletter in Mailchim. This was for leads that had completed the nurture, but didn't convert\nand traffic on the on 24 site pages were significantly increased so previously. They were a little under 200\nper week.\nand they have increased to over a 1,000 per week.\nAs far as nurture campaigns. We developed 2 separate tracks with 5 touches each one for ISP and one for Msp.\nThese were sent out on a weekly cadence, and began in April of 2,022\nas you can see below. Under the offer column we used a variety of assets.\nUnfortunately, we'd already use the existing ebook for Content Syndication, so we used a mix of blogs, case studies and\npapers\nfor these 5 touches.\nHere on the right, we have a couple of samples of these emails. One for is one for Msp.\nThe metrics for the ISP\nnurture track were to get significantly higher.\nYou can see the numbers here are well above industry standard averages, and as far as the Msp. Audience goes\nthese rates. They're not bad. They're just closer to the standards of the industry.\n \nSandi Settle\n05:18\nYeah, I think there's an opportunity here for us to work on the messaging for the Msps. That's one thing to point out to to kind of dial that in a little bit better.\n \nHoward Sewell\n05:26\nExactly. I I will stress, if I may just jump in. I you know, I think of industry standards, for a houseless like this is sort of, you know, 10 to 15% somewhere in there as being kind of, you know, a to good.\nSo 20% is nothing to be ashamed of or the click rate for that matter. But we've set ourselves a high bar, which is which is great, and and there's always room for for testing and optimization.\n \nAnila Baseel\n05:53\nI think these are great numbers. because the average industry rate for the open rate, it's not 20% right. It's probably less than that.\n \nHoward Sewell\n06:01\nYeah, definitely.\nYep. Exactly.\n \nGina Madson\n06:04\nYeah. And we're excited as we go into this next year we're going to have a lot more content. Both success stories and testimonials. So I think I hope that new, fresh, engaging content, especially a lot of video content will also play into better click through rates and the nurtures as well.\n \nAnila Baseel\n06:24\nAnd you know, I would add this because we probably need to start thinking about franchise, too.\non that.\nYeah, it's a big opportunity here. So we should talk about that for sure.\n \nGina Madson\n06:37\nOkay.\n \nSandi Settle\n06:40\nwe're here to help Gina.\n \nShirin Safavy\n06:46\nSo another accomplishment where the office hours webinars these consisted of spear speakers.\nUnfortunately, we don't have data for the earlier sessions. But we have really good data for the past 3 months, and we'll continue\nto have that in the future. So we can compare each session to the last.\n \nSandi Settle\n07:07\nYeah. Our hope is also to do some serving of your partners to see what they want to learn more about, and the type of content that they're interested in. But we'll build out a series for next year.\nWith that information, I think we're slated for February for our first one\n \nUnknown Speaker\n07:25\nfor 2,023.\n \nShirin Safavy\n07:26\nYes, that's correct.\nAnd here are some samples of the partner creatives These are the emails we sent through our third party partner\nand promoted through content. Syndication.\nyou can see at the top we use dual logos. So the quick books logo is always at the top right, and the partner Logo is on the left.\nWe strategically chose images that fit each industry. And you can see below in these samples we played around with the buttons to determine\nwhere\nthe best performance is. based on button placement, and determine that\nthe 2 green ones top placement performs best.\n \nAnila Baseel\n08:11\nand do we have numbers on how the messaging may have done like between. Notify Mendelssohn and margin Edge, like what resonated better with the audience.\n \nSandi Settle\n08:23\nWell, their audiences are a bit different because they're different industries. For the most part we can go back and analyze and take a look at them.\n \nAnila Baseel\n08:32\nI know we did a series. We did more for some of the partners than others, so we don't have as much to kind of compare to, but we can look at that, because we have the data and the performance, and each of them I'm asking is like, I see one of them is Nsp. Mandelson. The rest are. Is these\nWhat the feedback we got from is this was that they're looking more for us to do a\ncustomization approach in terms of messaging.\nThey have their own solution integrated to quick books. We have our own. So how do we make that peanut butter, jelly, sandwich kind of thing approach right with is. so i'm just wondering if one of them resonated better where we have more of a connected messaging.\n \nSandi Settle\n09:18\nOkay.\nwe'll take a look at that.\n \nGina Madson\n09:22\nYeah, I know for notify and margin edge we provide spear with the co-value proposition\n \nAnila Baseel\n09:28\ncontent and messaging. So yeah, it'd be curious to see if we do better with those that you guys did. we are working towards that Co. Marketing messaging. Okay?\n \nSandi Settle\n09:44\nWell, I think you'll see some of that. a little Further, we have a surprise to show you.\n \nShirin Safavy\n09:54\nOkay, and moving on to the part Prospect Partner Newsletter. So\nthe data below is for the first issue, which went out pretty recently on November first.\nclicks look good click to open rates look pretty great.\nSo\n \nSandi Settle\n10:12\nthe one thing we learned from this is we obviously need more content. So some of this is is also reaching out or utilizing some industry content as well. For educational purposes that we think you know they would be interested in, but we'd love more.\nI\ninto it related content.\nfor these newsletters moving forward.\n \nAnila Baseel\n10:36\nSorry I, my mindful, but I mentioned here. I think this for recruit. Probably.\nso. I almost feel like in the title is grabbing their attention because quick books is a big name. That's the o open rate that shows is.\n \nSandi Settle\n10:54\nand the CTO. Specifically, which is great\n \nAnila Baseel\n10:58\nWonder if we can align. And this is our problem. If we can align those leads to how we closed internally, or I'll be the right ones.\n \nGina Madson\n11:10\nSo this is the the Newsletter that we just started sending monthly Anila, and it's going to the long term nurture. So the leads that have already gone through sales and haven't converted yet so that this kind of like our drip continuing to message to them.\nso we've only yeah. I had the last month, really. And then the second one went out the beginning of December. But that's for sure something we're trying to track internally, and you know, like pass over. If someone re-engages\nand starts to raise our hand at the bottom of every Newsletter. It's a call to action to, you know, book time with LED basically so we're trying to promote that with these.\n \nAnila Baseel\n11:50\nSo, Gina, we don't know how many we got through meetings with LED\n \nGina Madson\n11:54\nas of this one. I don't believe any have been booked with end from the Newsletter right now, because they're overly a newsletter, and they're like, Wait, this is this is nothing. So we\nagain, if if it was all a 100% Qsp. Content, and they may not feel relevant either. So we need to\nchange up the mix of content. We had, you know, more industry, available news and\ncontent available. So that's kind of what we use, but\nthat isn't the plan long term.\n \nSandi Settle\n12:26\nRight?\n \nUnknown Speaker\n12:32\nOkay?\n \nShirin Safavy\n12:34\nOkay. So this chart on the right shows engagement time on the\npartner sites between February and October of this year.\nYou can see the time on the site is pretty low. It's not where we want to be. We want to increase engagement to keep people coming back.\nSo that is definitely something. We'll continue to work on\n \nSandi Settle\n12:59\nOne thing to call out there to the time on site\nwill help with refreshing, you know. As we get more content they'll have more reason to come back more frequently to, you know, spend time on site. They\nright now we're using the site more to come for one purpose like to register for something, and then they pop off. What we want to do is is, keep them there. Keep them looking, going deeper into the site, and so forth. So\nwe have talked to Gina about, you know, building out. Maybe some industry pages and things like that. what we can do as far as promotion of that site is limited because it's on on 24\nSomething to think about in the future is potentially building it like a micro site or something that we could actually do some social promotion to\nwe're limited in that now, but content is a big factor in keeping them there\n \nGina Madson\n13:54\nright. This is our on 24 hub, so it's not a main website. but it's where our lower content and our Webinar registrations are housed. So\nnot\nexactly a main partner website, but that is something that's in the works for\nfor next year. What I was also thinking right for future discussion is.\n \nAnila Baseel\n14:15\nwe have this. We're also internally working on our quickbooks.com site\nto add partner specific page, and we have to drive that page also. So when you talk about a micro site\nthat could be a gateway coming into our quick books. Right? so we can drive traffic one. Another driver would be our directory. So we're hoping to get that more robust, and that's going to be our partners outward facing to customers.\nOkay. So how do we help them generate on the for marketing piece there? Also?\n \nUnknown Speaker\n14:58\nOkay.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:01\nSorry. Taking notes.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:05\nI think it is important to note just looking at this chart here that visitors have been increasing.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:11\nSo, we're headed in the right direction.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:14\nAnd\nnow that we're seeing momentum with visitors, we just want to keep them there longer and keep them coming back.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:23\nExactly.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:28\nOh, now it's happening again.\n \nSandi Settle\n15:30\nI\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:31\nThere we go.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:37\nOkay.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:38\nSo campaign. Sorry, guys.\nit's like it knows everybody is on this. Call it doesn't want to cooperate.\nSo looking at the nurture campaign results, As I mentioned earlier, we had 2 separate tracks, 5 touches each.\nYou can see we're pretty close to industry averages. Those are listed at the very bottom of this chart.\nSome touches performed better than others. we've recently been working on rewriting some of this copy, so we do look forward to seeing how they'll measure in the next few months. Compared\nto these measurements.\nand the Msp. Track actually performed much better than is V. Which makes sense. When you think about it, because most of the assets we used, or\nvery closely related to Msp.\nfor example, this third touch here performed really well.\nSo.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n16:42\nhmm.\n \nShirin Safavy\n16:44\nAnother thing I wanted to point out is that in the beginning of our engagement we were sending these emails manually. So Spear was manually going into mailchimp and sending the touches out each week.\nand as we added to the series, and had a complete set of 5, we were able to recreate the nurture within mailch as an automated series.\nSo and gina i'm sure you remember that.\nSo I want to be sure that you know these numbers are based on the automated series, not the manual.\n \nGina Madson\n17:14\nOkay.\n \nShirin Safavy\n17:19\nAnd this is a summary slide of the partner Webinar programs for post-event promotion.\nThese partners receive content syndication leads after their webinar.\nAnd the reason there's no costs per lead for the first one for margin edge is because we used and make good for that project\n \nAnila Baseel\n17:42\nfor these numbers.\nI I guess I need to understand what the definition of lead is. is it just? if it is just attendees. Then let's call it out. 1 50 attendees right? Because when we'd say, when we talk about these numbers to sales, they like leads\noh, leads. They consider as qualified. So, unless we have a qualification, we should probably say attendees. The other thing is from for my team. I think we we're at a point, Gina, where we could look at these coming in. And if we, how can we\ncontinue the journey of where these are from the partner, and that's going to be a tough one.\n \nGina Madson\n18:24\nYeah. So with these ones we have report the attendees and the registrants separately. And then this was actually after the fact. After the Webinar. We syndicated it as a piece that someone could go out and register for and targeted that syndication through spears, various\nagencies right to those targeted audiences. So these leads are people that clicked on it and said, oh, I want to watch that Webinar i'm, you know, going to register. So then we pass them over to the Qsp. And they fit the audience criteria that you're looking for. Specifically.\n \nSandi Settle\n19:00\nSo\nit it's kinda in between. They've raised their hand. They're interested, and they fit the right profile as\nas a lead.\n \nGina Madson\n19:08\nright? And so the feedback we've gotten from hinge and margin edge so where I Haven't heard definitively from asterisk. But that is, these are really good quality, and that they are the contacts that they want at the companies that they want to be talking to\nbut it's been mixed as they're reaching out to them, and that that lead is like\nvery familiar with it, and understand who they are and why they're reaching out to. Okay, yeah.\nI just clicked on that. It does sound interesting to me. But why are you calling me right. So like it is definitely a top of funnel lead. But it's getting them like I said, the right people at the right companies to fill that top of funnel. Then it's up to the partner to really nurture them.\n \nAnila Baseel\n19:50\nYeah, i'm wondering if we could do anything with and lift all this and and lift it a partner that we have\nwhere you know they're looking at data and a lot of vertical specific stuff. And so, even just to understand like for margin edge, or if we bucket them into verticals, so hinge full margin edge if they do a concer i'm just making this up. I don't know construction, or you know a\ninventory management solution. What are the profiles that we're looking at? Because there's going to be a lot of partners. I see specifically that are playing in the same vertical. And so how do we segment each of their specialty into that? So that's something that we could, you know, do but i'm just mentioning to.\nGina Lexi and Louise is\nif there's an if if we can create a almost like a propensity model on for each of the verticals.\n \nHoward Sewell\n20:49\nquick question. Actually, we're going to touch upon\npropensity a little later on in the in the deck quick. This question almost for for both teams. But i'm wondering in light of Gina's comment about the mixed response to outreach. Can we help provide guidance, or maybe sample scripts, or anything to these partners, one\nfor their outreach, because we hear that a lot with content syndication programs occasionally, whether the clients where leads get thrown over the fence to sales. Sales thinks they are following up on people that have expressed interest in the product. Basically\nAnd there is so. So there is sort of like a disconnect when you know. So i'm just wondering if that's something that we can\nmaybe help\nguide in a\nin a gentle way, and improve that.\nImprove that response for sure, open to it. I mean, we are pretty\n \nGina Madson\n21:40\nclear with the marketer at the queue at the partner right? That like that's what happened. This is what happened, but i'm not there controlling how they're passing into sales, and I don't know right. I think march and edge is an exception. but for him to go I know that they don't have refined\nnurture process right and different levels of sales who would be reaching out at different times. So for sure, it's something that we can do better and enable our usps with better.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n22:13\nOkay.\n \nHoward Sewell\n22:15\ncool.\n \nSandi Settle\n22:16\nYeah, I think we'll touch on it a little further down to, as you know, some of the challenges with understanding, you know. Measurement on the back end of how they, how they're doing, and how they're, you know, moving through the funnel.\ncertainly would love to be more involved in, you know. Get more transparent feedback from them, so that we can put that into our campaigns and follow up\nyour screen.\n \nShirin Safavy\n22:45\nGreat. So I will hand things over to Sandy.\n \nSandi Settle\n22:48\nAll right next slide, please.\nSo we asked Gina upfront here. if she could do a swat analysis of our relationship.\nso that we could, you know, ensure we're giving the best service possible. You know. What do we do? Well, what can we improve? I won't. Go through and read all of this, but I wanted it as part of the deck, because it is something that we're working. You know.\nWe're keeping front of mine and working on some of the things that you mentioned, where you know we do really well at the kind of lead, generation side on content, syndication and campaign execution, working on the webinars content.\nplanning and strategy. and then I I do think our relationship between our team is is strong that communication is great.\nSome areas that we can improve our, you know, on timelines. we're actively looking at ways that we can.\nyou know, keep that. Keep the projects moving quickly, making sure that we're hitting those timelines, and we, you know we added more resources onto the account as well, and Lynn and her team have been working harder on, you know.\nrefining the the messaging and trying to get those. You know the audience messaging just right. So we're gonna continuously work on that\nand we're looking at different vendors to also to see how we can refine the audience a little bit better for you as well, and finding new ways to reach. You know your target Audience.\nnext slide, please.\n \nAnila Baseel\n24:26\nSo I just on that.\nI know Gina and I talk quite a bit and thank you for sharing the learning on the content piece. Right? I mean, I know that, you guys you've tried and stuff. But honestly, we have agencies that we work with very in a, you know, deeper workshop place, and they've been on board, and they really integrated so\nhonestly from that point of view, we could get to some of the content that we've already created. And one thing that we have put in place is Harry on our team is doing the overall messaging, and we just tap into those, you know messages, right? So we're. We are putting things in place that are better because we understand that there's different places where we are going to use that content from. So you know, there's there's improvements happening on our site as well.\n \nSandi Settle\n25:14\nOh, absolutely. We know that there there are things in place. I know some things have been stuck in legal, and there have been some challenges with people being gone, and you know, nothing moves as quickly as as we would like them to, but we definitely have probably hit\nthe end of the content that we have now. So we're eagerly awaiting, you know, new assets moving forward. But if there's ever a need to do that, and we hope to be doing that more with some of the partners themselves with the marketplace program.\nThat, you know. That would be wonderful, too, is to be able to show up to share some of that.\nwe also looked at some of the opportunities and threats just to get some feedback on the industry itself. and you know, if there's any gaps in our service, or where we could help more. and so we were listening on here. We realized that you know most of the social has moved over to corporate.\nBut if there's anything that we can do from the standpoint of creating content or posts, or anything to you know. Move that along faster. Obviously we're here for you.\nLet's see here.\nwe're doing our best to get the most out of your budget to drive new leads for the Qs themselves, and also for the partner Acquisition.\nI think here we all see that the industry is slowing slightly. and budgets are, you know.\nbeing held closely.\nbut I still think that we've seen a lot of successes, and we're able to apply that kind of moving forward to get more and more efficient at helping those partners, you know, find better ways to reach their audiences and target those messages more clearly.\nNext slide, please.\nSo overall what we think went well was the communication between our teams. You know we've had really open honest discussions, but things don't work, and when they do Gina has been great at sharing everything that she sees on her side that help, you know. Help us all do better.\nwe've had the ability to test different approaches and pivot. You know quickly when things aren't working.\nwe have some resources in place that help us, you know. Get better organized and communicate better. I think we review things very quickly. The teams got open flow of communication between the channels and the\nthe regular meetings as well. we have some flexibility and adding\nadditional resources on the sphere side when there's upticks in work. So we've brought more people onto the team, and we I think we have a solid team in place.\nNext slide, please.\nSome of the challenges we, you know we had a hard time with that live Webinar\nevent promotion upfront. We learned from that, and I think we've been able to do a lot better.\nReplacing that offer with the on demand recordings and doing the promotions on the back end. also increasing kind of the mix of content that we have to work with so ebooks and case studies and things like that. when possible. Ebooks, obviously are, are one of the\nthe pieces most in demand.\nyou we discussed the partner commitment needed to kind of complete the post event. Follow up, and maybe this is an opportunity for us to help help you help them by creating some.\nmaybe best practices, as Ha! Hey? Howard had mentioned on scripts, and, you know, follow up emails to kind of level out the playing field for those partners that may not have the resources to do that.\nWe recommended kind of the creation of some\ntop of funnel ebook assets that incorporate things like case studies or snippets and testimonials. But that has a little bit more of a thought leadership. Focus. Those do much better in the ads than you know, sending them to just landing pages to go kind of look for content themselves.\nOur lack of ebook and white paper assets kind of made some of the lead generation efforts to little challenging for contents, education and and paid media advertising.\nSo we we, as I said before, we could use a little bit more of a mix of assets to kind of freshen those nurtures, and continue with the monthly newsletters. populating those. So there's no big surprises there\nmessaging.\nyou know we did find that we need some differentiation on the messaging between the audiences. They were a little too similar, I think, as you said we're working on it. It's been getting better and better.\nthe Intuit team has provided us more information, any background such as you know, surveys or any feedback that you got from your events last week, that potentially we can kind of incorporate that into the messaging\nto make it a little bit. You know more refined\nreporting as an area that we still are having some challenges, I would say, in in measuring how we're doing from a revenue, perspective and opportunities to a generated from the programs that we're doing so potentially getting salesforce access or\nregular reporting from that could help also getting some reporting from the partners themselves\nwould be beneficial.\nthe on 24 landing pages are acceptable, but\nthe fact that there's only kind of one version of the form makes some of the lead generation that we want to do.\nyou know, unattainable we recommend, maybe designing and building additional landing pages with new forms and mailchimp potentially in that in the future\nthat will help with the lead Gen. Needs, and enable us to kind of measure more\nthat lack of engagement tracking and the results from meet the experts. As we go forward, so we can kind of see how we're doing on those that would be helpful as well.\nand let's see mailchimp, you know. Mail 10 third. There are some\nareas there where we can't quite build some of the templates that we want to Some of the modules just had to be kind of tweaked to translate\nvisually in mailchimp\nbut we were able to kind of overcome that with the newsletter\nareas of opportunity the content development is is one of those areas where\nwe could use a little mix of content for the industry pages potentially creating content that's specific to those different industries. So whether it's construction or inventory management.\nmaybe creating some more content that's specific to those industries. the potential to maybe survey or interview partners to to find topics of interest, or, you know, get some some expertise on messaging from them\nidentifying cop topics of interest from your conference. I know we haven't had a chance to talk about how it went last week, but we look forward to hearing a little bit about that\nthe creation of the partner. Videos case studies and blogs that you're talking about will be exciting. for the New Year.\npotentially refreshing. That messaging based on, you know, audience surveys or interviews. is a a potential area of opportunity, and also to extend that nurture.\nconsider, maybe adding the event in a box to the menu of services for the partners for the the partner marketplace.\nwhere, since\nmany of the partners are getting back into doing live events, maybe that's an in the area of opportunity where we can package that, like we talked about earlier in the year into a program.\nand then building a monthly program for tracking on the activities that we're doing for the partners. So maybe there's a way to incentivize the partners, maybe to send back revenue or opportunity results from those Content syndication programs and other things.\nso that we can kind of get some more 2 way feedback.\nAny questions there?\n \nUnknown Speaker\n34:08\nOkay.\n \nGina Madson\n34:09\nNot a good question. But just I think on it\ncomment for the Content development. I mean any of this is something we had talked about at different points, but as we get more Qsps and have more verticalized focused content for recruiting or finding customers, I should say, for our Qsps\nwith on 24, if we had a deeper set of content right. We could have some more of those always on kind of\n \nUnknown Speaker\n34:36\ngo ahead.\n \nGina Madson\n34:37\nGoogle as as well as complementary content syndication campaigns going that are for the vertical. So then we're getting and passing weeds for partners, right? Which I know we're not yet at from a corporate standpoint, but that's kind of an option to explore down the road.\n \nAnila Baseel\n34:55\nYeah, I actually made a note sending on and you, Haven't here is.\ncan we maybe do a a focus group with the partners right? Specifically? one. A focus group for is one for Msps and really understand. Look, this is what we've delivered so far. What?\nWhat is all the things that you\nmay use right.\nThey've been doing business before even they became our partner\nfor a long time. They know how to get leads and how we land those. So if we were to leverage that information and their expertise. How do we enable them? Maybe they might be something that you know, because we're all there with some marketers, and\nyou get into our little bubble of like, hey marketing, should we do this? But sometimes when you hear things from sales, it's a light bulb going off. Oh, wait! We could have tweaked it this way, so it'd be great, because we have a lot of activities under the belt. And so how do we create the next, you know, level of\nenablement for the partners. If that's focus group that they'll be open to and trust me. Our qs are pretty open, and their voice their opinion. It'd be great to have those, you know. Call it the suggestion. I know you already have that on your board.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n36:09\nRight?\n \nSandi Settle\n36:10\nYeah, I think that would be wonderful.\nThe more information they have, the more you know more we can refine.\nand with that said, we do have an in one idea that Howard is going to talk about with an an additional partner that we work with.\nNext slide. Please\n \nHoward Sewell\n36:29\ncut my cue. That's your cue\nI got. I got given a couple of slides, so i'd feel useful. which is very nice. yeah, i'll go through this quickly, but you know, full disclosure. Rev. Is a a very new partner relationship for us. In fact, it's, you know we Haven't even really formalized\nthe relationship. But they're a really interesting company, and one that we on the spear side.\nI think that we could leverage across a pretty broad swath of client engagements, and we're in a mode right now in the early stages where we've done a couple of little tests with a couple of clients, and we're looking to do a few more. 3.\nTo gauge how clients could leverage the the data that comes out of these tests, which i'll explain so Rev. Is a. A company. Basically it's a AI-based technology, and they build a\na model of your Icp ideal customer profile based on a list of your best customers. So you give them a list of 20 customers, and say, these are: If we had another 500 of these, that would be, that would be great, and they feed that into their model and output.\na couple of things. One is other companies that look like those same customers.\nAnd secondly, what are the common characteristics that define those companies beyond the usual pharmographic. So\ngeography, company, size, industry, etc., but also what Rev. Calls hexagraphics, which is basically information on how companies execute. So\nare they an early adopter or a late adopter? Are they focused on customer service, that sort of thing, and they also they build that model based on the list the company provides. They run it against a database of 6 million dollars, 6 million companies.\nThey identify those key characteristics, and then they also come back to us with. Here are other companies that look like\nthe companies you're telling us\nare\nyour best customers.\nIf you can go to the next slide.\nShreen. Thank you.\nso this has been. we've done this a couple of times now. In fact, we're presenting our second to another client this later this week, but it has the potential to be a useful tool, we believe, on a couple of fronts one\nit could identify other, but other Isvs and Msps that are out there that are most similar to the partners that you want best to capture and bring into the program. It may identify\nspecific.\nhigh potential segment. So we may. It may be a way to identify\nthat we didn't realise it, but the partners who sell to this type of company, or that have the certain characteristic end up being our top performing partners. And if we learn more about\nwhat makes those\npartners your best\npartners, it could help inform things like messaging and content, and and that sort of thing. So our offer to you, he says, is to is to take a list of your top partners, and literally all we need is like 20 company names in their urls.\nWe'll hand it over to Rev. They'll provide us, and there's no charge for this.\nThe 2 outputs that I mentioned. They'll give us a list of these hexagraphics that are common to those companies. The one important note. There is, the larger the companies\nthe better the insights. And we've learned this the hard way, so you know, and then it has a lot to do with web presence. So the the larger the web presence the company has, the more information Rev. Can capture, so it preferably be\npartners on the upper tiers of where you guys kind of operate, and they'll also provide us\na sample list of lookalike companies from their database.\nAnd then, if we found the data compelling, and this is completely without obligation. We could then look at.\nmaybe acquiring data from Rev. They also have a lead generation platform which operates in a similar sort of content syndication\nmodel where you go to them and say, hey, i'll a\nX amount per lead, if you can find me. Other companies that look like these partners. So again the ask is.\ngive us a list of 20 companies. We'll come back to you with some data.\nno charge for doing so. The the ask in in from our side is, Tell us what you think\nis this: is this interesting? Is this useful? Could you use it?\nIs it compelling, is it? It doesn't really tell us anything we didn't already know?\nbut it's an exercise we'd love to.\nWe'd love to run.\nand I think that's it.\n \nAnila Baseel\n41:31\nHoward. Thank you for for reviewing this with us, and the answer to your questions is all the above.\nHowever, we do have already a vendor that we work with, and we we're working with the the vendor from a sales perspective, too, because they're connected there, so that you know the partners and lift. And we we do do all of these things that you're you're mentioning with them.\n \nHoward Sewell\n41:59\nSo okay\n \nAnila Baseel\n42:00\nappreciate the opportunity.\n \nHoward Sewell\n42:02\nYeah, absolutely. And I confess it again. It's a relatively new relationship\nfor us. We were excited about it because\nit allows us to kind of\nbring some technology to bear help. Refine the kind of work that we do. Everything that Sandy and Sri have been talking about content development email creative, you know targeting, etc. So we wanted to make it available to you. If frankly, if you want to do it, even as just a point of comparison.\nyou know, next to what you're getting from the other company. That is absolutely fine, but it's entirely your your.\nyour your option.\nSo\n \nAnila Baseel\n42:39\nthank you.\n \nHoward Sewell\n42:40\nYou're welcome\n \nSandi Settle\n42:42\nnext slide, please.\nSo we put together a quick action plan. Some ideas, maybe, for next steps for you and the team to take a look at and\nlet us know. You know you want us to move forward with this, but we're move we're in the development process. Sorry i'm a little tongue tied. we're in the development process for that with the cin 7 evoke\nso potentially it's As soon as that's completed we could write some blog articles on it to show how those like integrated solutions\nhelp, you know SMS and use that in the Newsletter in the resource center.\nwe could continue to work on some new industry specific topics to fill in the gaps in the resource center in the newsletter as well.\nAnother idea is to create a short script video script for that ebook as well to use in prom promotions\nto move forward with the survey questions for partners. And maybe in this case, if we don't do the survey, we could do a workshop where we could get more, you know in depth understanding\nof partner needs, but that\nthe idea here was to get ideas on their interests and topics for the office hours, webinars, but also new content pieces.\nAnalyze those survey results and suggest and some new topics for Webinars moving forward. So these are sort of like quick hits that we've identified.\nIs there anything there that you would like to add to, or anything like?\n \nAnila Baseel\n44:30\nJust a questions being that you can talk in a minute to get ready for the other for the next meeting.\nSo for the top of the funnel, content. These should be in the mark, the marketing service catalog, because initially, we had. We had helped the partners. Now we're saying, we need to Co. Invest. So\nif we don't have the video, and I'm. I'm forgetting, Louise. If we don't have the video or the blog article, or whatever from Sphere and Msc. Then we should probably add these, and that needs to be funneled through the marketing service catalogue.\n \nSandi Settle\n45:07\nGotcha. Yeah, okay.\nOn the next slide we wanted to show you. I believe it's the next slide. we wanted to show you\nsomething that we created using some of the initial data from the send 7 ebook process. We're still working on the ebook itself. But this is one example of what we can do with some of those data insights, and creating other pieces of contents that could extend the life of the campaigns, and this here is a infographic we'll provide the link to the sample right now. since Ivan has not seen this yet, either. So it's hot off the press. But this is\none exciting idea one way to visualize some of that data\nthat\nthat they provided as well.\nso our thought was to potentially, you know, turn this into a video or something as well. If the the client is interested, the prospect I have to jump off. But just 2 things. For example, one is, and we don't have to answer it on this call. One is that\n \nAnila Baseel\n46:15\nwe're trying to be out there in technology software? so how do we compete? And what are we not doing today that we could potentially look into right\nas next step for F 23. And the other is that I know Gina is amazing, and the teams really great. And you guys have been working amazingly. what else do you need from us? For me? From Gina, or anything that would make your lives a little bit easier other than content? what you know how. How else can we help you?\nbe more successful?\n \nSandi Settle\n46:48\nI think, understanding a little bit more about your overall goals for your you know your program itself and your slice of the business, I think, and understanding what you're trying to achieve for next year will help us.\nYou do do better.\ndo you have anything to add in here, Howard.\nunderstanding a little bit more about your lifetime goals, and how we measure success, you know, moving forward.\n \nHoward Sewell\n47:18\nYeah, I mean, it's always great to understand the larger goals and the grander objectives I would defer to you, Sandy, and the team being closer to the day to day than I am. But again it's it's a great\nrelationship, and one that is very collaborative, and a lot of information flowing back and forth. So\nyou know we are at this point. We are.\nyou know, and proving on\nthings that are\ngenerally working pretty well. So but we'll, you know we'll, we'll take that, you know. We'll take that request away and come back with ideas as well, so that's fair.\n \nGarrett Lawrence\n47:59\nGarrett. Did you have a question? No, i'm just gonna say, I mean, I agree anything as we learn about the specifics behind your goals and objectives that's really helpful, you know, if there's additional needs in terms of thought, leadership, and building your stature. If there's anything in customer, partner, advocacy you have, there's different things that we can contribute to. So happy to explore that and come back to you with some some thoughts.\n \nSandi Settle\n48:22\nThat's great. Thank you guys. I have to jump off, and this is really awesome. Thank you so much.\nGina Lexi. Do you have any questions?\n \nGina Madson\n48:34\nNo, i'm excited to see the ebook and the infographic, for some of them looks great, too, so that'll be great to have is the first one, and it sounds like march and edges back on track to move forward with theirs, too. So 2 of those up there to test in separate markets very different audiences. So right?\n \nSandi Settle\n48:52\nOkay, I think I have a last slide. Sorry, and this is just next steps.\nIf you could\nadvances side one more for me.\nI think next steps. Obviously, you know. Consider what's in here. We'll send you the Dac so we could develop a project plan, you know, moving forward. Some of the things we want to do is test some new vendors for the app marketplace campaign. we'd like to get approval\nan an understanding of what we're going to be moving forward with. We have a I think a straw man as to what kind of what our next\nquarter looks like, but maybe developing in the that plan out for Q. 4 2023, the April to June timeframe.\nwe will expedite the completion or we would like to expedite the completion of the ebook asset that your team is working on for content syndication.\nand we will share the infographic internally. And we're\nworking on the last touches for the ebook for cin 7 as well, and then potentially launching that partner survey or doing a workshop, whichever is best there. And if you discuss internally that you want to, you know, try out the Rev.\n \nHoward Sewell\n50:16\nOffer the insight, and i'm going to take an action item there, if I may, and that's too, because frankly, I don't know the answer to this is what makes them different, if at all, from in left.\nBecause I i'd i'd want to make sure that there's you know the differentiation and a value. Add there that would make even that exercise worthwhile. And so why Don't? Why, don't I find that out first, and then Gene and team we can. We can get back to you as to whether we still think that's maybe worth\nconsidering. So\n \nGina Madson\n50:52\nyeah, that'd be great. I'm curious to know myself. I'm sure there are some variations there, and\nI think a test would be fascinating. We just we've pulled back a little bit from our recruitment focus to emphasize more of our with partner marketing and activity. So I think that's maybe where there's a little hesitation to immediately jump in and test it. But yeah, and and again, just to be clear, I mean, this is just you know\n \nHoward Sewell\n51:17\nus running and running your customer list through their database, coming back with a few slides, and that's as far as it\nneeds to go. So it's basically just it's free data. But again, to the extent that you maybe are already getting all those insights.\nI just want to make sure it's worth even that amount of time, and that'll be on us to find out, and we'll get back to you.\n \nGina Madson\n51:37\nYeah, I mean, we do have a within. Let's not just quickly say, but we are still struggling to target effectively. We want to recruit into our program. So if there could be deeper levels of insight or takeaways or insight, you know, period information is generally helpful. So\n \nHoward Sewell\n51:55\nI I would love to test it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's great. Well, let me. Let me find out what the differences are, and then we can. We can. We can well work with Sandy and team, and we can talk about what the next steps might be.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n52:08\nSounds good.\n \nSandi Settle\n52:10\nWell, thanks, everybody, for the time we'll see you in a few minutes. I'm gonna take a quick break, and then we'll jump on the other. The other call.\n \nLynn Dodds\n52:18\nI don't think I am.\n \n\n\n Save & SubmitCancel"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is TCAM in networking?TCAM (Ternary Content Addressable Memory) is a specialized memory used in networking devices to store and quickly look up information such as routing table entries and data used in access control lists.TCAM works by storing multiple pieces of data along with corresponding masks, and can perform a match by comparing the stored data and masks with a search key. If there is a match, the TCAM returns the index of the matching entry. This allows TCAM to perform fast searches for specific data in a large table, making it useful for tasks such as routing and forwarding packets in a network.TCAM is typically more expensive and has a higher power consumption compared to other types of memory such as SRAM or DRAM, but it is able to perform searches much faster than these other types of memory. As a result, TCAM is often used in networking devices where fast lookup times are critical.what is SDN? in networkingSDN (Software-Defined Networking) is a networking architecture that separates the control plane, which determines how data is forwarded through the network, from the data plane, which forwards the data.In a traditional networking architecture, the control and data planes are closely tied together and function as a single entity. This can make it difficult to change the way the network functions, because any changes to the control plane must be implemented in hardware.In an SDN architecture, the control plane is implemented as software that runs on a separate network device, such as a server or a virtual machine. This device is known as a \"controller.\" The data plane consists of networking devices such as switches and routers, which are programmed to forward data according to the instructions received from the controller.By separating the control and data planes, SDN allows the network to be more flexible and easier to manage. Network administrators can use the controller to quickly and easily change the way data is forwarded through the network, without having to make physical changes to the networking devices. This can help improve network performance and reduce downtime.Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) is a routing technique that allows a network to use multiple paths of equal cost to forward traffic between two points. It is often used to provide load balancing and redundancy in a network.In an ECMP network, multiple paths between two points are treated as equal, and traffic is distributed among these paths based on a hash of the source and destination addresses of the traffic. This allows the network to evenly distribute the traffic across the available paths, which can help to improve performance and reduce congestion.ECMP is often used in conjunction with link aggregation, in which multiple physical links are combined into a single logical link to increase capacity. By using ECMP with link aggregation, a network can take advantage of the increased capacity provided by the multiple links while still distributing traffic evenly across the available paths.ECMP is an important technique for improving the performance and reliability of networks, and is widely used in enterprise and datacenter networks.can you explain WAN?WAN (Wide Area Network) is a type of computer network that spans a large geographical area, such as a state, a country, or even the entire world. WANs are used to connect smaller networks together, such as those in local offices or branch locations, and can be used to share data and resources such as Internet access, file servers, and other applications.WANs are typically implemented using leased lines, satellite links, or other types of long-distance communication technologies. They can be owned and operated by a single organization, or they can be shared by multiple organizations.One common type of WAN is the Internet, which is a global network of networks that connects computers and devices all over the world. Other examples of WANs include corporate networks, educational networks, and government networks.WANs are important because they allow organizations to connect their networks together and share resources and information across large distances. This can help to improve communication and collaboration, and can also help to increase the efficiency of business operations.can you explain WCMPI'm sorry, but I'm not familiar with WCMP. Could you provide more context or clarify what you are asking?can you explain WCMP - related to ECMPI apologize for misunderstanding your question earlier. WCMP (Weighted Carrier-Grade NAT Multi-Path) is a load balancing technique that is similar to Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP). Both techniques allow a network to use multiple paths of equal or different cost to forward traffic between two points.WCMP is often used in Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT) environments, where a single external IP address is shared among multiple devices on a private network. In a WCMP setup, traffic from the private devices is distributed among the available paths based on weights that are assigned to each path. The weights can be used to adjust the balance of traffic between the paths, allowing the network to favor certain paths over others.Like ECMP, WCMP can be used to improve the performance and reliability of a network by distributing traffic evenly across the available paths. It can also be used to provide redundancy in the event that one of the paths becomes unavailable. However, unlike ECMP, WCMP allows the network to assign different weights to the available paths, which can be useful in certain scenarios where some paths may have different capabilities or characteristics.what is k-means algorithm when it comes to Niagara at networking?The k-means algorithm is a method for clustering data points into a specified number (k) of groups or clusters. It is an iterative algorithm that works by choosing k initial centroids, and then assigning each data point to the cluster whose centroid is closest to it. The algorithm then updates the centroids by calculating the mean of the data points in each cluster, and repeats the process of reassigning data points to the closest centroids until convergence.In the context of Niagara, the k-means algorithm may be used to cluster data points related to network performance or other metrics. For example, the algorithm could be used to group together devices or locations that have similar characteristics or behaviors, which could be useful for identifying patterns or trends in the data.The k-means algorithm is a popular and widely used method for clustering data, and it has many applications in fields such as data mining, machine learning, and pattern recognition. In the context of networking, the algorithm may be used to analyze and understand network performance and behavior, and to identify areas for improvement or optimization.explain me widely about the Niagara algorithm, give some examples, make it simple to understandThe Niagara algorithm is a routing algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between two points in a network. It is an extension of the Dijkstra algorithm, which is a widely used algorithm for finding shortest paths in graphs.The Niagara algorithm is designed to handle networks with large numbers of nodes and links, and is particularly well-suited for use in software-defined networking (SDN) environments. It works by maintaining a set of \"frontier\" nodes that represent the current state of the search for the shortest path. The algorithm then iteratively expands the frontier by adding the lowest-cost neighboring nodes to the set, until it reaches the destination node.One key advantage of the Niagara algorithm is its ability to handle dynamic networks, where the topology and cost of links can change over time. It is able to adapt to these changes by continuously updating the cost estimates for the nodes in the frontier.Examples of where the Niagara algorithm might be used include:Routing packets through a large enterprise networkFinding the shortest path for a self-driving car to take through a cityDetermining the most efficient route for a delivery truck to take through a network of roads and highwaysOverall, the Niagara algorithm is a powerful tool for finding the shortest path between two points in a network, and is widely used in a variety of applications where efficient routing is important.what do you mean by  \"frontier\" nodes?In the context of the Niagara algorithm, a \"frontier\" node is a node that represents the current state of the search for the shortest path between two points in a network. The frontier is a set of nodes that the algorithm is actively exploring as it tries to find the shortest path.As the algorithm runs, it starts at the source node and expands the frontier by adding the lowest-cost neighboring nodes to the set. It then continues to expand the frontier by adding the lowest-cost neighbors of the nodes in the frontier, until it reaches the destination node.The concept of a frontier is useful in the Niagara algorithm because it allows the algorithm to efficiently explore the network and find the shortest path, while avoiding the need to visit and recalculate the cost of nodes that have already been processed. This makes the algorithm more efficient and allows it to scale to large networks.so which apporoach is commonly used right now? niagara? WCMP ? ECMP?Both Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and Weighted Carrier-Grade NAT Multi-Path (WCMP) are commonly used techniques for load balancing and distributing traffic across multiple paths in a network. These techniques are often used in conjunction with link aggregation, which combines multiple physical links into a single logical link to increase capacity.ECMP works by treating all available paths as equal and distributing traffic evenly across them based on a hash of the source and destination addresses. WCMP is similar to ECMP, but allows the network to assign different weights to the available paths, which can be useful in certain scenarios where some paths may have different capabilities or characteristics.The Niagara algorithm is primarily used for routing and finding the shortest path between two points in a network. It is an extension of the Dijkstra algorithm, which is a widely used algorithm for finding shortest paths in graphs.Which of these approaches is commonly used depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the network. ECMP and WCMP are often used in enterprise and datacenter networks to improve performance and provide redundancy, while the Niagara algorithm is commonly used in software-defined networking (SDN) environments and other large networks where efficient routing is important.can you write me a short pseudo code that implements the Niagara algorithm with explantion commentsCertainly! Here is a short pseudo code that implements the Niagara algorithm for finding the shortest path between a source node and a destination node in a graph:Copy code// Declare a frontier set to store the nodes that are being explored\nfrontier = {source}\n\n// Declare a distances map to store the cost of reaching each node from the source\ndistances = {source: 0}\n\n// Declare a predecessors map to store the previous node on the shortest path to each node\npredecessors = {source: null}\n\n// While the frontier is not empty\nwhile (frontier is not empty) {\n    // Select the node with the lowest cost in the frontier\n    current_node = node in frontier with the lowest cost in distances\n\n    // If the current node is the destination, we have found the shortest path\n    if (current_node == destination) {\n        break\n    }\n\n    // Remove the current node from the frontier\n    remove current_node from frontier\n\n    // For each neighbor of the current node\n    for each (neighbor in neighbors of current_node) {\n        // Calculate the cost of reaching the neighbor from the source\n        cost = distances[current_node] + cost_of_edge(current_node, neighbor)\n\n        // If the neighbor is not in the distances map, or the cost of reaching it is lower than the current value\n        if (neighbor not in distances or cost &lt; distances[neighbor]) {\n            // Update the distances map with the new cost\n            distances[neighbor] = cost\n\n            // Update the predecessors map to indicate that the current node is the predecessor of the neighbor on the shortest path\n            predecessors[neighbor] = current_node\n\n            // Add the neighbor to the frontier\n            add neighbor to frontier\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// At this point, either the destination has been reached or the frontier is empty\n// If the destination has been reached, we can reconstruct the shortest path by following the predecessors from the destination to the source\nThis pseudo code implements the basic idea behind the Niagara algorithm, which is to iteratively expand a frontier of nodes that are being explored in order to find the shortest path between the source and destination nodes. The algorithm maintains a set of distances and predecessors for each node, which are used to track the cost of reaching the node from the source and the previous node on the shortest path, respectively.Whats truncate and binary expansion in Niagara algorithm please explain and give some examplesIn the Niagara algorithm, truncate and binary expansion are two techniques that can be used to improve the performance and scalability of the algorithm.Truncate is a technique that is used to prune the search space of the Niagara algorithm by limiting the number of nodes that are explored at each iteration. This can help to reduce the number of calculations that are performed by the algorithm, and can also reduce the memory requirements of the algorithm.For example, consider a graph with 1000 nodes, where the source node is node 1 and the destination node is node 1000. Without truncate, the Niagara algorithm would have to explore all 1000 nodes in order to find the shortest path. However, with truncate, the algorithm could be limited to exploring only the first 100 nodes at each iteration. This would reduce the number of calculations that are performed by the algorithm, and would also reduce the memory requirements of the algorithm.Binary expansion is a technique that is used to improve the performance of the Niagara algorithm by reducing the number of nodes that are explored at each iteration. It works by grouping nodes into \"bins\" based on their distance from the source node, and then only exploring the nodes in the closest bin at each iteration. This can help to reduce the number of calculations that are performed by the algorithm, and can also improve the scalability of the algorithm.For example, consider a graph with 1000 nodes, where the source node is node 1 and the destination node is node 1000. Without binary expansion, the Niagara algorithm would have to explore all 1000 nodes in order to find the shortest path. However, with binary expansion, the algorithm could be limited to exploring only the nodes in the closest bin at each iteration. This would reduce the number of calculations that are performed by the algorithm, and would also improve the scalability of the algorithm.Why should we prefer the niagra algorithm?There are several reasons why the Niagara algorithm might be preferred over other routing algorithms in certain situations:It is designed to handle large networks with a large number of nodes and links, making it well-suited for use in software-defined networking (SDN) environments and other large networks.It can handle dynamic networks, where the topology and cost of links can change over time. This makes it a good choice for environments where the network is constantly evolving.It is able to adapt to changes in the network by continuously updating the cost estimates for the nodes in the frontier, which can help to improve the accuracy of the shortest path calculation.It is efficient and scalable, and can handle networks with millions of nodes and links.It has been extensively tested and is widely used in production environments, making it a reliable and proven choice for routing.Overall, the Niagara algorithm is a powerful and efficient tool for finding the shortest path between two points in a network, and is well-suited for use in large, dynamic networks where efficient routing is important.What is the cons? What should we consider when using niagaraLike any algorithm, the Niagara algorithm has its own set of trade-offs and considerations that should be taken into account when deciding whether it is the right choice for a given application. Some potential cons or limitations of the Niagara algorithm include:It requires the maintenance of a frontier set, which can use up memory and computational resources.It may not be the most efficient choice for small networks or networks with few nodes and links.It may not be the most accurate choice in situations where the cost of links changes frequently or unpredictably.It may not be suitable for use in real-time systems where extremely low latencies are required, as it may take longer to find the shortest path compared to other algorithms.When deciding whether to use the Niagara algorithm, it is important to consider the specific requirements and constraints of the application, and to weigh the potential pros and cons of the algorithm against other available options.Can you write some niagara algorithm Q&amp;A?Certainly!

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Finding ordonnance with drones \n\nWar has been a scourge for humankind since the dawn of history. It is fortunately true that after an extremely violent first half of the 20th century, the second half has seen a steady decrease in war violence (https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace). Tragically, however, even today war is raging in several parts of the world very much including in Europe since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  \n\nEven after a war has ended it continues to make victims. Most of the victims are due to the extra mortality caused by diseases and reduced life expectancy from economic hardship and the destruction of infrastructure. However, a particularly nasty heritage of war is the large number of mines and unexploded ordonnance. They can continue to make victims long after the war has finished. E.g. more than a century after WOI the enormous amount of unexploded ordonnance (including grenades with chemical weapons) in the “red zone” of the western front, continues to make victims, as farmers continue to plow up rusty grenades. People, often playing children, are often maimed for life if they hit on a hidden mine. Therefore, the risk posed by unexploded mines can make large land areas off limits.  In addition to the terrible human tragedies and the burden on usually already overburdened medical infrastructure, the denial of land that could be used for habitation, agriculture, or industry has large economic consequences. Thus, despite the risk and the high cost involved, mine and explosive disposal is one of the first priorities after a war. \n\nA particularly difficult problem in demining and explosive disposal is finding explosives that have buried themselves underground.  This can easily happen due to the shock of impact in soft soil, other explosives piling dirt or debris on top, or simply bomb craters being filled with soil to repair damage to the land after the conflict. Randomly digging for ordonnance in the deep soil is both destructive and prohibitively expensive. Moreover, even when digging is already necessary e.g. for the constructions of roads or buildings, or in deep plowing, accidentally finding ordonnance is not only risky, but also expensive as all activities have to be stopped to investigate, and dispose of the ordonnance. Thus, there is a considerable incentive to find bombs in the subsurface without digging. \n\nThe assignment is based on data of a drone equipped with a magnetic field sensor to detect ordonnance in the deep subsurface. Magnetic sensors measure static or oscillating magnetic fields in units of fractions of a Tesla (T) .  The magnetic field, traditionally denoted B is a vector quantity.  However, one often only measures only one component, (including for the datasets provided) i.e. a size and a sign.  \n\nThe simplest magnetic sensors work by measuring the change in the local magnetic field of the earth caused by a substantial amount of ferro-magnetic material such as the steel housing of a grenade. Since the earth magnetic field is much stronger (about 5µT) than the one produced by the material but essentially constant on the scale of a kilometer (but not on the scale of the earth!), one measures, in fact, a difference signal between two magnetometers separated by a meter or so. Since the magnetic field difference scales linearly with the distance (to first order), one is effectively measuring the gradient of the magnetic field. Alternatively, the sensor is connected to a probe that produces a changing magnetic field itself, oscillating with a frequency of the order of 10kHz. This is the method used by handheld metal detectors. A changing magnetic field will induce oscillating currents in metallic (i.e. conducting) objects  which in turn create an oscillating magnetic field which can be easily separated from the earth magnetic field and can be measured. This is the method used with handheld metal detectors. The advantage of this method is that it picks up other metals than iron.  It is also more sensitive to the depth of the material. This allows for a better estimate of the depth of the material (especially if one also has information on the conductivity of the soil), but it can also mean that one misses objects that are buried too deep underground.  \n\nThe data for the assignment has magnetic field measurements at different locations from a drone flying over a field following a scanning pattern. There is also data were bombs were actually dug out of the ground after drone data suggested there was something there. \n\n \nAssignment Part 1.\n \nFor this part of the assignment we only need the magnetic field data of field 9641-20220308-F1. \nThe data consists of an x coordinate (from west to east) and a y coordinate (from south to north) in meter, and a magnetic field component in nano-Tesla on a roughly 4 sided field.\n\nX [m] Y [m] Wert [nT]\n-0.463 22.455 -31.270\n-0.463 22.523 -32.160\n-0.462 22.591 -31.510\n-0.461 22.658 -29.810\n-0.460 22.726 -21.040\n-0.459 22.794

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are DApps?A DApp (Decentralized Application) is a software application that runs on a blockchain network. DApps are designed to be decentralized, meaning that no single entity controls the data or the rules of the application. They are typically built on top of decentralized platforms such as Ethereum, and use smart contracts to facilitate the creation, management, and execution of their rules and logic. Because of their decentralized nature, DApps are considered to be more secure and resilient than traditional, centralized applications. They can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, social networking, and more.What are smart contracts?A smart contract is a computer program that automatically executes the terms of a contract when certain conditions are met. It is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. Smart contracts can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as facilitating the transfer of assets or the execution of business logic.A key characteristic of smart contracts is that they are executed on a blockchain network, which means that once they are deployed, they cannot be altered. This ensures that the terms of the contract are clear and transparent, and that they will be executed exactly as written. Smart Contracts can be use to create decentralized applications (DApp) or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, by creating a set of rules, or instructions that are transparent, inviolable and executed automatically.How does one create a DApp?Creating a DApp (Decentralized Application) typically involves several steps:Design: The first step is to design the overall architecture of the DApp, including the user interface and the functionality that the DApp will provide. This includes deciding on the specific blockchain platform that the DApp will be built on, such as Ethereum, EOS, or others.Development: Once the design is complete, the DApp can be developed using the programming languages and frameworks that are supported by the chosen blockchain platform. For example, if building on Ethereum, developers will typically use Solidity to write smart contracts and Web3.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.Deployment: After the DApp is developed, it needs to be deployed to the blockchain network. This typically involves creating a smart contract and deploying it to the blockchain using a special tool such as Truffle or Embark.Testing: Before the DApp can be made available to users, it should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it functions correctly and that there are no bugs or security vulnerabilities. This can be done by manually testing the DApp and by using automated testing tools.Maintenance: After the DApp is deployed, it will need ongoing maintenance to ensure that it continues to function correctly and that any issues that arise are addressed promptly.It's important to note that building a DApp require a good knowledge of blockchain technology and the specific blockchain platform that you are using. Many DApps also require a deep understanding of smart contract development. It's a complex process and requires skilled and experienced developers to create a fully functional, reliable and secure DApp.Where is the data collected by DApps stored?The data collected by DApps (Decentralized Applications) is typically stored on a blockchain network. A blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a record of multiple transactions, and once a block is added to the chain, the information it contains cannot be altered.In the case of a DApp, each transaction represents a change to the state of the application, such as the creation of a new user account, the transfer of an asset, or the execution of a smart contract. This data is then stored on the blockchain, where it can be accessed and verified by anyone on the network. The distributed nature of the blockchain network ensures that the data stored on it is secure and tamper-proof.It's important to note that the data stored on the blockchain is public and visible to anyone, the transaction data and smart contract storage on the blockchain, it's not advisable to store sensitive information such as personal identification data on the blockchain. To mitigate this, alternatives such as encrypted storage or off-chain storage solutions, or use of zero-knowledge proof methods can be used.If data cannot be altered, how can DApps be updated?While it's true that once data is written to a blockchain, it cannot be altered, this does not mean that DApps (Decentralized Applications) cannot be updated. The process of updating a DApp typically involves deploying new versions of smart contract on the blockchain, which will implement the changes or updates.There are different ways of updating a DApp, depending on the specific use case and the requirements of the application:New Contract: One way to update a DApp is to deploy a new version of the smart contract, and redirect all incoming calls to the new contract. This approach is useful for making changes to the business logic of the DApp, but it requires users to adopt the new contract, and it can cause disruptions to the service if not done correctly.Proxy Contracts: Another way to update a DApp is to use a proxy contract, which acts as an intermediary between the user and the main contract. The proxy contract can be updated to redirect calls to a new version of the main contract, allowing for seamless updates without disrupting the service.Upgradeable Contracts: Some blockchain platforms, like Ethereum with EIP-1884 and EIP-2929, support the concept of upgradeable contracts, which allow for a smart contract to be updated in-place, without the need to deploy a new contract. This approach allows for more flexible upgrades, but it requires additional smart contract design and development.It's important to note that updates, regardless of the approach chosen, may still require user action, such as adopting the new version of the contract. It's also important to thoroughly test the new version of the contract and to ensure the new version is backwards compatible with previous versions. Additionally, when making changes to a contract that is already in use, developers have to carefully consider the implications for any existing users and any assets that are tied to the contract.How do you update user information on DApps?Updating user information on a DApp (Decentralized Application) typically involves making changes to the data stored on the blockchain. The exact process for updating user information can vary depending on the specific DApp and the blockchain platform it is built on, but generally it would involve the following steps:Data validation: The first step is to validate the user's new information to ensure it is accurate and that it meets the requirements of the DApp.Updating smart contract: Once the user's new information has been validated, it is then passed to the smart contract responsible for managing user information. This smart contract would include functions to update user data, usually this is a function that can be called only by the user, or by the DApp owner.Transaction: The update function of the smart contract is called, and this will generate a new transaction on the blockchain. This transaction will contain the new user information and will be added to the next block in the blockchain.Confirmation: After the transaction has been added to the blockchain, it is considered confirmed, meaning that the update to the user information has been recorded and is now part of the permanent record on the blockchain.It's important to note that the data stored on the blockchain is transparent and publicly visible, that's why it's not advisable to store sensitive information such as personal identification data on the blockchain. Alternatively, to mitigate this, sensitive data can be stored off-chain, and a reference hash of the data can be stored on the blockchain, or data can be encrypted before storing on the blockchain.If sensitive data is stored off-chain, how can it interact with the DApp?If sensitive data is stored off-chain and not on the blockchain, it can still interact with a DApp (Decentralized Application) in several ways:Hashed reference: One way to allow sensitive data to interact with a DApp is to store a cryptographic hash of the sensitive data on the blockchain, and to store the actual sensitive data off-chain. The hash is a unique, fixed-size representation of the data that is generated by a one-way function, it can't be reversed. The DApp can use the hash to look up the actual sensitive data off-chain, and then use that data in the application.Encrypted communication: Another way to allow sensitive data to interact with a DApp is to use encrypted communication between the DApp and the off-chain storage. The sensitive data is encrypted before it is stored off-chain, and when it is needed by the DApp, it is decrypted and passed to the DApp over a secure communication channel.Off-chain computation: A third way of allowing sensitive data to interact with a DApp, is to perform computations that use the sensitive data off-chain, and return the result to the DApp. For example, the DApp can use zero-knowledge proof methods, to verify the sensitive data without revealing it to the blockchain.It's important to note that while storing sensitive data off-chain can help to protect the privacy and security of users, it still requires careful consideration and design. For example, it's important to ensure that the off-chain storage is properly secured and that the communication between the DApp and the off-chain storage is properly encrypted. Additionally, it's important to consider the regulatory and compliance implications of storing sensitive data off-chain, and to ensure that the solution is compliant with all relevant laws and regulations.What are the possible security risks of a DApp?DApps (Decentralized Applications) have several unique security risks that need to be considered:Smart contract vulnerabilities: DApps rely on smart contracts to manage and execute the logic of the application. If these smart contracts contain bugs or vulnerabilities, they can be exploited by malicious actors to steal assets, manipulate the application, or cause other types of damage.Dependency risk: DApps often rely on other systems, such as third-party APIs, oracles, or other smart contracts to function. If these systems are compromised or malfunction, they can cause the DApp to fail or to function in unexpected ways, which can lead to security issues.Phishing and Social Engineering: DApps that handle assets or money, can be vulnerable to phishing and social engineering attacks, where malicious actors trick users into sending assets or money to the wrong address.Privacy Issues: Since the data on the blockchain is transparent and publicly visible, this can cause privacy issues, as anyone can see transaction data, including user information. To mitigate this, sensitive information can be stored off-chain, and a reference hash of the data can be stored on the blockchain, or data can be encrypted before storing on the blockchain.Regulatory Compliance: DApps that handle money or assets, can be subject to various regulatory requirements, and non-compliance can result in legal issues.Custodial Risk: DApps often rely on centralized custodians, to hold and manage assets. However, if the custodian is compromised, the assets can be lost or stolen.Failure to Scale: DApps may also fail to handle high numbers of users, which can lead to downtime or errors.It's important to note that the field of smart contract security is still relatively new, and new risks and vulnerabilities are still being discovered. Additionally, DApps are constantly evolving and changing, so it's important to keep up to date with new developments and best practices to ensure the security of the DApp.What are the most famous DApps?There are many different DApps (Decentralized Applications) that have been developed and are currently in use, and the popularity and fame of each one can vary depending on factors such as the specific use case, the blockchain platform they are built on, and the overall level of adoption and engagement.Here are a few examples of popular and well-known DApps:Uniswap: Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Ethereum that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies in a trustless and decentralized way.Compound: Compound is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform built on Ethereum that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies in a trustless and decentralized way.MakerDAO: MakerDAO is a decentralized lending platform built on Ethereum that allows users to borrow DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the value of the US dollar, using their Ethereum as collateral.CryptoKitties: CryptoKitties is a blockchain-based virtual game that allows players to purchase, collect, breed, and sell virtual cats.Golem: Golem is a decentralized computing network built on Ethereum that allows users to rent out spare computing power in order to perform complex computations.Augur: Augur is a decentralized prediction market platform built on Ethereum that allows users to create and place bets on the outcome of events.These are just a few examples of the many DApps that have been developed and are in use today. DApps can be found in different blockchain networks, like EOS, TRON, among others. The space of DApps is rapidly evolving, and new DApps are being created all the time to tackle various use cases and verticals.Can there be a social media DApp if there are threats to personal security, as well as scaling problems?It's possible to create a social media DApp (Decentralized Application) on a blockchain network, but there are several challenges that would need to be addressed in order to ensure the security and scalability of the platform.One of the main challenges for a social media DApp is ensuring the security of personal data. As I mentioned before, the data stored on the blockchain is transparent and publicly visible, which can cause privacy issues, as anyone can see transaction data, including user information. To mitigate this, sensitive information can be stored off-chain, and a reference hash of the data can be stored on the blockchain, or data can be encrypted before storing on the blockchain. Additionally, efforts need to be made to prevent phishing and social engineering attacks and to ensure the regulatory compliance of the platform.Another challenge is scalability. Social media platforms can have millions of active users, and it's crucial that the platform can handle high numbers of users, and a high volume of transactions, without downtime or errors. Some blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, have been criticized for poor scalability, making it hard to support high-traffic DApps. The current solutions being researched to solve scalability issues are solutions like layer 2 solutions (like Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups) and sharding.Despite these challenges, there are already some social media DApps built on blockchain networks, such as Steemit and Peepeth, which uses a different approach to handle the scalability problem. These examples show that it is possible to create a social media DApp, but it requires careful consideration of the potential risks and challenges, and addressing them through smart design, development and operation choices.What are the advantages of a DApp compared to normal apps?DApps (Decentralized Applications) have several advantages compared to traditional, centralized apps:Decentralization: The most fundamental advantage of a DApp is that it is decentralized, meaning that no single entity controls the data or the rules of the application. This means that DApps are more resilient to failures, censorship, and single point of failures.Security: DApps use blockchain technology, which provides a high level of security for the data and transactions stored on the platform. The immutability of the data stored on the blockchain, as well as the decentralized nature of the network, makes it much harder for hackers to tamper with the data or steal assets.Transparency: DApps are built on blockchain technology, which means that all transactions are recorded and stored on the blockchain, making them transparent and publicly accessible. This can increase trust and accountability in the system, and can make it easier for users to verify the integrity of the data.Autonomy: DApps are designed to be autonomous, meaning that they can operate independently of any centralized authority or intermediary. This can reduce the costs associated with intermediaries, such as transaction fees, and can make it easier for users to interact with the platform.Censorship resistance: As DApps are decentralized and operate independently of intermediaries, they are resistant to censorship. DApps can continue to function and allow users to interact with the platform, even if centralized intermediaries or governments attempt to shut them down.Programmable money: The smart contracts that are used to build DApps can also be used to create decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which can provide new financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, in a trustless, decentralized and transparent way.It's important to note that DApps are a relatively new technology, and their implementation is still evolving. While DApps offer many advantages, it's important to also consider the potential risks and challenges, such as scalability and regulatory compliance, to ensure a successful and secure DApp.If there are no central figures, who decides how or what to update on a DApp?In a traditional centralized application, updates and changes are typically made by the central authority or organization that controls the application. However, in a DApp (Decentralized Application) there is no central authority, so the process of making updates and changes can be more complex.The process of updating a DApp is typically decided by a community of stakeholders, which can include users, developers, investors, and other interested parties.Community Governance: Some DApps are governed by the community of users, who have the power to vote on changes and updates to the platform. This can be done through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that allows token holders to vote on proposals for changes or updates.Hard forks: other DApps uses a consensus mechanism where the community of stakeholders reach an agreement on what changes need to be made, and then the network is \"forked\" into a new version of the DApp that includes the changes. This approach is used in some blockchain networks like Ethereum, which allows for changes to the protocol by means of hard forks.Dev-led Governance: In some cases, the development team or the creator of the DApp, may lead the process of making updates and changes. This approach is more centralized and relies on the development team to actWhat is the difference between DApps and open sourced apps?The main difference between DApps (Decentralized Applications) and open-source apps is that DApps are built on top of a decentralized blockchain network, while open-source apps can be built on a centralized infrastructure.Here are a few key differences between DApps and open-source apps:Decentralization: DApps are decentralized, meaning that there is no central authority controlling the data or the rules of the application. Instead, the data and transactions are stored on a blockchain, which is a decentralized network of computers. Open-source apps, on the other hand, can be controlled by a central authority or organization.Security: DApps use blockchain technology, which provides a high level of security for the data and transactions stored on the platform. This security is derived from the decentralized network and the consensus mechanism of the blockchain network. Open-source apps, while they may also have security features built-in, they may not have the same level of security that DApps have.Transparency: DApps are transparent, meaning that all transactions are recorded and stored on the blockchain, making them publicly accessible. In contrast, open-source apps may or may not have the same level of transparency, depending on the application and the architecture.Autonomy: DApps are designed to be autonomous, meaning that they can operate independently of any centralized authority or intermediary. On the other hand, open-source apps may depend on centralized intermediaries or authorities to operate.Censorship resistance: DApps are resistant to censorship, as they operate independently of intermediaries or centralized authorities, and can continue to function and allow users to interact with the platform, even if intermediaries or governments attempt to shut them down. Open-source apps, however, can be censored or shut down by authorities or centralized intermediaries.It's also important to note that not all open-source apps are decentralized, and not all DApps are open-source. But it is common to see DApps being open-source, in order to allow the community to review and audit the code, and to create trust in the platform.What are the centralized infrastructures mentioned here?In the context of DApps (Decentralized Applications) and open-source apps, a centralized infrastructure refers to a system or network that is controlled by a central authority or organization.Here are a few examples of centralized infrastructures that can be used to build open-source apps:Web servers: A web server is a centralized infrastructure that stores and manages the files and data for a web application, and serves them to users upon request.Cloud Services: Cloud services, like AWS, GCP, Azure, etc. are centralized infrastructures that provide remote servers and other resources that can be used to host and run web applications.Databases: A database is a centralized infrastructure that stores and manages data for an application, and can be controlled by a central authority or organization.These infrastructures are considered centralized because they are controlled by a single entity or a small group of entities, and they may have a single point of failure or control. They offer a centralized point of control to the application, data, and user access. In contrast, DApps use blockchain technology, which allows for a decentralized network of computers to control the data and the transactions, and provides resilience to failures, censorship and a single point of failures."}]}

We carry out a doctrinal legal analysis to scrutinise the concepts of “work”, “originality” and “creative freedom”, as well as the notion of authorship, as set forth in the EU copyright acquis and developed in the case-law of the Court of Justice. On this basis, we develop a four-step test to assess whether AI-assisted output qualifies as an original work of authorship under EU law, and how the existing rules on authorship may apply. Our conclusion is that current EU copyright rules are generally suitable and sufficiently flexible to deal with the challenges posed by AI-assisted output.\n\nIntroduction\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) is making inroads into the realm of culture, the alleged creative powers of intelligent machines are reaching almost mythical proportions. Spectacular examples abound, ranging from the impressive The Next Rembrandt,Footnote 1 a Rembrandt-style portrait created with the help of algorithms, to the uncannily well-crafted translations by DeepL.Footnote 2 Indeed, AI-assisted creation nowadays encompasses almost the entire spectrum of subject matter listed in Art. 2(1) of the Berne Convention.\n\nThe creative powers of advanced AI systems have led some scholars to conclude that the results of artificial creation cannot be protected by copyright, since human beings have lost control of the creative process.Footnote 3 Some writers, therefore, argue for the introduction of special neighbouring rights to protect “authorless” AI-generated output against misappropriation.Footnote 4 But is this assumption correct? Or can AI-assisted output qualify for copyright protection, despite the increasingly important role that machines play in its creation?\n\nTo be sure, this is not an entirely new question. As early as the 1960s scholars have grappled with questions related to computer-generated works.Footnote 5 With the rise of AI, in particular machine learning techniques, the issue has gained momentum and inspired a vast new body of legal scholarship in recent years.Footnote 6\n\nIt is beyond the scope of this article to provide a detailed definition of AI systems – something we have endeavoured to do elsewhere.Footnote 7 We also refer to the abundant literature on the subject, some of it in the field of intellectual property.Footnote 8 Moreover, multiple definitions have been advanced at EU level, in various initiatives from the European Parliament, the European Commission, and their research services.Footnote 9 In this article, we rely on the broad definition advanced in the Commission’s 2021 proposal for an AI Act.Footnote 10 According to this definition, which builds on previous policy work by the High-Level Expert Group on AI,Footnote 11 an AI system means “software that is developed with one or more of the techniques and approaches listed in Annex I and can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate output such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing the environments they interact with”.Footnote 12 Annex I lists various techniques and approaches, including: (a) different types of machine learning (supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement) using a variety of different methods (e.g. deep learning); (b) logic- and knowledge-based approaches; and (c) statistical approaches.Footnote 13\n\nThis article poses the question whether and to what extent works produced with the aid of AI systems – in short, AI-assisted output – are protected under EU copyright standards. “AI-assisted output” is intended to refer to all output, applications or works generated by or with the assistance of AI systems, as defined above. What is central to the following analysis is not the intelligent machine, but the role of human beings in the AI-assisted creative process. Is this role sufficient to elevate the result of this process, the AI-assisted output, to the status of a copyright-protected work?\n\nThis article is based on a study commissioned by the European Commission,Footnote 14 the conclusions of which inform the policy position on AI-assisted creation adopted by the Commission in its 2020 IP Action Plan.Footnote 15 This follows several policy initiatives at EU level on the intersection of AI and copyright, including on the protection of AI output.Footnote 16 The analysis presented here is largely doctrinal. Normative questions about the most desirable protection regime for AI-assisted output are not addressed. Neither do we examine alternative regimes available under current law, such as neighbouring rights or unfair competition law.Footnote 17\n\nTo begin with, in Sect. 2 we present a general overview of the current framework of EU copyright law as it pertains to copyright protected “works”. In Sect. 3, we turn to the core question whether and under what conditions AI-assisted output qualifies as a “work” protected under harmonised copyright standards. To this end, we closely scrutinise the notions of “work”, “originality” and “creative freedom”, as developed in the case-law of the CJEU. As we shall demonstrate, the CJEU’s decisions in Painer and Football Dataco offer important clues in answering our research question.Footnote 18 In Sect. 4 we address the issue of authorship of AI-assisted output, which is intimately linked to that of the notion of “work”. Nevertheless, since this notion has so far remained largely unharmonised, nationally divergent solutions have been developed, such as the rules on authorship of computer-generated works in UK and Irish copyright law.Footnote 19 In Sect. 5 we present our conclusions.\n\nThe Evolving EU Standard of “Work”\nThe current EU copyright framework is mostly silent on questions of copyright subject matter and authorship. Despite extensive copyright harmonisation, no single directive harmonises the concept of the work of authorship in general terms. Article 1 of the Term DirectiveFootnote 20 comes fairly close to a general definition by referring to copyright subject matter as “a literary or artistic work within the meaning of Art. 2 of the Berne Convention”.Footnote 21 In its jurisprudence, the CJEU similarly seeks guidance from Art. 2(1) of the Berne Convention, which, through its incorporation by reference into the TRIPS Agreement and the WCT,Footnote 22 has become part of the EU legal order.Footnote 23\n\nThe EU acquis expressly harmonises three – or possibly four – specific categories of copyright-protected subject matter: computer programmes, databases, photographs, and (possibly) works of visual art.Footnote 24 Each of these qualifies as a protected work if it is “original in the sense that it is the author’s own intellectual creation”. In its 2009 Infopaq judgment, the CJEU extrapolated from this piecemeal harmonisation a general, autonomous concept under EU law of the work as “the author’s own intellectual creation”.Footnote 25 This has been confirmed in later judgments, most recently in Levola Hengelo, Funke Medien, Cofemel and Brompton Bicycle.Footnote 26\n\nProduction in the Literary, Scientific or Artistic Domain\nFrom the definition of “work” in Art. 2(1) of the Berne Convention follows a general requirement that works be produced within the “literary, scientific or artistic domain”. Whereas some scholars have given normative meaning to this categorical notion,Footnote 27 the CJEU has not clearly embraced this “domain test” as a separate criterion. In Premier League the Court denied copyright to sporting events for the reason that they “cannot be regarded as intellectual creations classifiable as works”,Footnote 28 which possibly suggests an application of the domain test. However, elsewhere in the judgment it transpires that the Court’s exclusion of sporting events is based on the lack of originality.Footnote 29 Similarly, in Levola Hengelo the Court could have relied on this test to deny “work” status to the taste of a food product. Instead, it formulated a criterion of “identifiable” expression to achieve the same result.Footnote 30 It is therefore not clear whether this general test is incorporated into EU copyright law.\n\nHuman Intellectual Effort\nLike the Berne Convention, the EU copyright acquis is primarily grounded in the tradition of author’s rights (droit d’auteur): copyright protects original expression directly emanating from a human creator. The Berne Convention does not define the “author” of a work, leaving this to the contracting parties, but its text and historical context strongly suggest that “author” and “authorship” for the purposes of the Convention refer to the natural person who created the work.Footnote 31 This implies that copyright protection initially vests in human authors.Footnote 32 This is confirmed by the Convention’s ubiquitous references to the “author” as the originator of works and the beneficiary of protection. The Convention’s provision on moral rights (Art. 6bis) that are expressly granted to “authors” underscores that its minimum standards of copyright protection are triggered only by acts of human creation.\n\nAlthough EU copyright law nowhere expressly states that copyright requires a human creator, its “anthropocentric” focus (on human authorship) is self-evident in many aspects of the law.Footnote 33 For one thing, the CJEU’s case-law on originality, discussed below, completely relies on the notion of a human being engaging in creative acts – reflecting “creative choice”. As the Court considered in Painer, “[b]y making those various choices, the author of a portrait photograph can stamp the work created with his ‘personal touch’”.Footnote 34 The point is reinforced in Cofemel: “if a subject matter is to be capable of being regarded as original, it is both necessary and sufficient that the subject matter reflects the personality of its author, as an expression of his free and creative choices”.Footnote 35\n\nAlso, according to the CJEU, the exclusive harmonised rights accorded to the author in the InfoSoc Directive necessarily attach to a human creator, not a legal entity such as a film producer or publisher.Footnote 36\n\nPerhaps the clearest formulation of this principle comes from Advocate General Trstenjak in her opinion in Painer, where she concluded from the wording of Art. 6 of the Term Directive, that “only human creations are therefore protected, which can also include those for which the person employs a technical aid, such as a camera”.Footnote 37 This conclusion was endorsed by the Court.\n\nHuman rights provide additional arguments in support of the proposition that copyright presupposes human authorship.Footnote 38 For example, the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR) protects the moral and material interests of authors resulting from scientific, literary or artistic production. Given that human rights by definition vest in human beings, the concept of authorship under the UDHR necessarily refers to human authorship.Footnote 39\n\nIn sum, the requirement of human intellectual effort excludes from copyright protection output produced without any human intervention.Footnote 40 For example, the aesthetically pleasing flowers of a rose or wings of a butterfly cannot be qualified as works. Likewise, output wholly generated by an AI system without any human intellectual effort is excluded from copyright protection. This requirement does not rule out, however, creations by human authors made with the aid of machines, provided that the human contribution to the output meets the legal standard of originality/creativity, to which we now turn.Footnote 41\n\nOriginality/Creativity\nThe EU standard of “the author’s own intellectual creation” requires that the subject matter must be (i) “the author’s own”, that is, not copied, and (ii) an “intellectual creation”.Footnote 42 This twofold requirement usually goes by the name of “originality”. As the CJEU, rather circularly, held in Levola Hengelo and Cofemel: “the subject matter concerned must be original in the sense that it is the author’s own intellectual creation”.Footnote 43 In Painer and Funke Medien, the Court clarified that intellectual creation implies originality, which in turn implies making personal,Footnote 44 creative choices.Footnote 45 This was more recently confirmed in CofemelFootnote 46 and Brompton Bicycle.Footnote 47\n\nThe Painer decision is particularly instructive, as it concerns subject matter created with the aid of a machine – notably a photographic portrait. According to the CJEU, a portrait photographer\n\ncan make free and creative choices in several ways and at various points in its production. […] By making those various choices, the author of a portrait photograph can stamp the work created with his “personal touch”. Consequently, as regards a portrait photograph, the freedom available to the author to exercise his creative abilities will not necessarily be minor or even non-existent.Footnote 48\n\nIn Infopaq, a case involving the protection of newspaper articles against unauthorised scanning, the focus of the Court’s originality enquiry is on “the form, the manner in which the subject is presented and the linguistic expression”.Footnote 49 The CJEU clarified that, for literary works, the author’s “free and creative choices” pertain to the selection, sequence and combination of words.Footnote 50 While admitting that words in isolation do not amount to intellectual creation, the Court adds that it is only through “the choice, sequence and combination of [those] words [that] the author [may express] his or her creativity in an original manner and [achieve] a result which is an intellectual creation”.Footnote 51\n\nOriginality or creativity do not, however, imply a requirement of artistic merit or aesthetic quality.Footnote 52 EU copyright law protects works of high art as much as it protects more mundane intellectual output, such as simple photographs, industrial designs, databases or computer software. Conversely, as clarified in Cofemel, the fact that a work “may generate an aesthetic effect” is no reason to qualify it as subject matter protected under EU copyright law.Footnote 53 This is an important observation in relation to AI-assisted output, much of which is undeniably of aesthetic value.\n\nThis focus on the act of creation in terms of making free and creative choices implies that economic investment cannot, as such, justify protection. In Football Dataco, the Court squarely rejected “significant skill and labour” on the part of the producer of football fixture lists as a relevant factor in assessing originality.Footnote 54 Similarly, in Funke Medien the Court considered “the mere intellectual effort and skill of creating [military status] reports are not relevant in that regard”.Footnote 55\n\nIn essence, the EU law requirement of originality is met “if the author was able to express his creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices”.Footnote 56 In a string of cases the CJEU has had the opportunity to elaborate on the relevant parameters for such creative choices. Importantly, the Court has identified various types of external constraints to creativity: rule-based, Footnote 57 technical Footnote 58 or functional,Footnote 59 and informational.Footnote 60 All these may play a role in the legal assessment of AI-assisted output in distinct cases.\n\nThe CJEU does not, however, seem to require that the author’s creativity or personality (“personal stamp”) be objectively discernible in the resulting expression (the output). What appears to be sufficient is that prospective authors exercise their “free and creative choices” and thereby express their personality.Footnote 61 But is that enough – or does the law additionally require that the “creative space” be creatively used, as the ideas are being expressed in the final production? On the face of it, the case-law does indeed suggest the latter. The Court speaks of choices that must be “creative”, and that “[b]y making those various choices, the author of a portrait photograph can stamp the work created with his ‘personal touch’”.Footnote 62 This language suggests that exercising creative freedom in a non-creative way, e.g. by making only obvious choices, would not result in a protected work. On the other hand, as we have seen before, the requirement of originality or creativity does not entail a test of artistic merit or aesthetic quality, or that the work be novel (new).\n\nNational courts have dealt with this problem in different ways. For example, the Dutch Supreme Court expressly denies copyright protection to “trivial” or “banal” expression, even under conditions of broad creative freedom.Footnote 63 The copyright cases so far decided by the CJEU do not give much guidance on how to assess the “creativeness” of the act of creating, if at all; nor do they define a minimum standard of creativity.\n\nEarly CJEU decisions suggest that if the external constraints allow an author sufficient creative freedom, then the level of creativity actually required by the Court is fairly low.Footnote 64 In Infopaq the Court suggested that even a short (11-word) text fragment might qualify.Footnote 65 On the basis of the reasoning in Painer, the originality of a photographic work is practically a given.Footnote 66 Even in a case concerning run-of-the-mill school portrait photographs, “the freedom available to the author to exercise his creative abilities will not necessarily be minor or even non-existent”.Footnote 67 This suggests that even a combination of fairly obvious choices in the design, execution and editing of an AI-assisted output could suffice.\n\nBy contrast, in Funke Medien, the Court (in line with Advocate General Szpunar) expressed serious doubts over whether the military status reports at issue could qualify as “works”, since the standard format of these reports and their purely informational purpose left (too) little room for creative choices.Footnote 68 Even though the Court’s reasoning in Painer and Funke Medien point in different directions, the focus of the CJEU’s originality analysis in both cases is on the availability of creative choice.\n\nExpression\nA fourth prerequisite for copyright protection is that the human creator’s creativity be “expressed” in the final production. The use by the author of their creative freedom must be somehow perceptible in the author’s expression. Ideas that are not given shape or form cannot qualify as “works”. The CJEU has on several occasions confirmed that expression is a sine qua non for copyright protection. Both in Infopaq and in BSA, the Court states that the author must have “express[ed] his creativity in an original manner”.Footnote 69 In Painer, the CJEU observes that, for a work to be original, the author must be able to “express his creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices”.Footnote 70 Similarly, in Funke Medien the Court opines that “only something which is the expression of the author’s own intellectual creation may be classified as a ‘work’ within the meaning of Directive 2001/29”.Footnote 71 And in Levola Hengelo the Court has underscored that the author’s creative choices must be sufficiently clearly expressed in the interest of legal certainty.Footnote 72\n\nThis requirement of expression implies a causal link between an author’s creative act (the exercising of their creative freedom) and the expression thereof in the form of the work produced. But it remains unclear whether and to what extent the original features of the work should (all) be preconceived or premeditated by the author. Indeed, it is fair to assume that the concept of a work as “the author’s own intellectual creation” requires not only human agency or intervention, but also some degree of authorial intent.Footnote 73 If a work must be “created” by a human “author” and subsequently “expressed”, then this notion clearly cannot encompass wholly haphazard acts of nature, such as the shape of a flower or a solidified lava stream.\n\nBut does copyright law require specific intent of every original feature of the work, or does overall authorial intent suffice? Assuming that human authorship goes hand in hand with – and often partly relies on – fortuitous expression, such as slapdash paint drippings in a work of art, a requirement that all expressive features of the work be preconceived would be too strict – and not supported by existing law and practice.Instead, general authorial intent is probably enough. That is to say, it is sufficient that the author has a general conception of the work before it is expressed, while leaving room for unintended expressive features.Footnote 74\n\nIn the end, the CJEU’s focus on creative choice as the hallmark of intellectual creation suggests that it is the process of creating rather than the ensuing act of expression that is truly decisive for copyright protection, provided there is an attributable connection between the creative process and the expression.Footnote 75 This conclusion is in line with EU law’s rejection of artistic or qualitative merit as a relevant criterion for protection.\n\nIn sum, current EU copyright law, as interpreted by the CJEU, leaves room for the protection of AI-assisted output in a wide range of creative fields. As long as the output reflects creative choices by a human being at any stage of the production process, AI-assisted output is likely to qualify for copyright protection as a “work”.\n\nIs AI-Assisted Output a “Work”? A Four-Step Test\nIn the light of the preceding analysis, we shall now examine whether AI-assisted output can qualify as a “work” protected under EU copyright law. Our focus is on output produced by or with the aid of an AI system. This is in line with a clear trend towards the use of general-purpose (“off-the-shelf”) AI software or services for the production of creative content.Footnote 76 In the following we will generally assume a “user” of an AI system, not involved in its development, who produces an artefact with the aid of the system – the AI-assisted output. It is this user, and this artefact, that will be central to our copyright analysis.\n\nAs our inquiry into EU copyright law reveals, a four-step test must be met for an AI production to qualify as a “work”:\n\nStep 1: Production in literary, scientific or artistic domain;\n\nStep 2: Human intellectual effort;\n\nStep 3: Originality/creativity (creative choice);\n\nStep 4: Expression.\n\nStep 1: Production in the Literary, Scientific or Artistic Domain\nAs noted, much AI-assisted output resembles archetypal works, and belongs to “the literary, scientific or artistic domain” without any difficulty. AI systems are capable of generating almost the entire spectrum of types of work mentioned in Art. 2(1) of the Berne Convention, including news articles, poems, musical compositions, paintings, maps, industrial designs, geographical maps, photographs, and films. For these kinds of output, passing this initial test will therefore be unproblematic, assuming the domain requirement is a material prerequisite under EU law at all.\n\nStep 2: Human Intellectual Effort\nIn addition, to qualify as a “work”, the AI-assisted output must be the result of human intellectual effort. The criterion of human intervention does not, however, rule out AI production as a matter of course. As the CJEU has clarified in Painer, it is entirely possible to create works of authorship with the aid of a machine or device.\n\nMoreover, if we leave aside the futuristic scenario of a completely autonomous creative robot, AI-assisted output will always go hand in hand with some form of human intervention, be it the development of the AI software, the gathering and choice of training data, the drawing up of functional specifications, supervision of the creative process, editing, curation, post-production, etc. Even if the connection between the human intervention and the AI-assisted output is increasingly remote, at this point in time it is hard to conceive of content that is generated through AI that involves no human agency whatsoever. What is problematic today and for the immediate future is whether, and to what extent, a natural person’s involvement with the AI-assisted output – however remote – is sufficient for it to qualify as an intellectual creation. This brings us to the third criterion.\n\nStep 3: Originality or Creativity (Creative Choice)\nThe third and most crucial criterion is originality or creativity. In the words of the CJEU, this test is met “if the author was able to express his creative abilities in the production of the work by making free and creative choices”.Footnote 77 As we have seen, the emphasis here is on the existence (a priori) of sufficient creative space, rather than on the creativity of the production as such.\n\nAs the Painer case illustrates, creative choices may occur at various levels and in different phases of the creative process: preparation, execution, and finalisation.Footnote 78 Consequently, a creative combination of ideas at distinct stages in the creative process might be enough to qualify the result as a “work” protected under EU copyright. With the Painer decision as inspiration, it is useful to have a closer look at the process of creating works with the aid of AI systems. As the Painer court has well understood, creativity in machine-aided production may occur in three distinct phases of the creative process, which we propose to label “conception”, “execution” and “redaction”.Footnote 79 The figure below provides a simplified diagram of this iterative creative process (Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 1\nfigure 1\nDiagram of an iterative creative process\n\nFull size image\nThe conception phase involves creating and elaborating the design or plan of a work. This phase goes beyond merely formulating the general idea for a work.Footnote 80 It requires a series of fairly detailed design choices on the part of the creator: choice of genre, style, technique, materials, medium, format, etc. It also involves conceptual choices relating to the substance of the work: subject matter (news article, portrait), plot (novel, film), melodic idea (musical work), functional specifications (software, databases), etc.Footnote 81 As the CJEU has clarified in Painer, creative choices at this pre-production stage are important factors in a finding of originality of the final production.\n\nIn the case of output created with the aid of machine learning (ML) algorithms, above and beyond the design choices identified above, additional conceptual choices may involve the choice of AI system (e.g. the type and characteristics of the models used), as well as the selection and “curation” of input data (e.g. in the labelling of training data) and other parameters.Footnote 82 With AI-assisted output most of these conceptual choices will be exercised by human actors. The AI system at this stage has no role in the creative process other than acting as an external constraint limiting the designer’s creative possibilities.\n\nThe execution phase involves, in simple terms, converting the design or plan into what could be considered (rough) draft versions of the final work. This phase involves the production of text, the painting of artwork, the notation or first recording of music, the “shooting” of photographs or video, the “coding” of software, etc. With traditional forms of creation, the role of a human author at this execution stage is crucial. The novelist converts the plot for a novel into words, the composer translates musical ideas into notes. From the 19th century onwards, machines have played an increasingly important auxiliary role in this creative phase. Photographs and films cannot be made without cameras, music not recorded without recording devices, etc. Nevertheless, the human author has always stayed in full control of the execution phase. That is to say, the role of the machine was essentially that of a tool in the creative process.\n\nWith AI-assisted creation this has arguably changed, in degree if not in nature. ML systems can be instructed and trained to perform complex tasks and produce sophisticated output in ways that the user of the system will not be able to (precisely) preconceive, understand or explain. From the user’s perspective, this creates the impression of an autonomously operating system: one that the user does not fully control or comprehend, and that strains the classification of an AI system as a “tool”. This is particularly true for Deep Learning systems, where the architecture based on several layers of neural networks greatly increases the distance between the user and the machine during the execution phase.Footnote 83\n\nWhereas some AI systems are capable of generating highly sophisticated, “work-like” content at this stage of the creative process, the quality of the output should not be mistaken for proof of “creativity”. What is essential for our copyright analysis is human creativity.\n\nFinally, the redaction phase involves processing and reworking the draft versions produced in the execution phase into a finalised cultural product ready to be delivered to a publisher or other intermediary, or directly to the market. This final phase may involve a wide range of activities, depending on the genre and medium of the product. These include extensive rewriting, editing, correction, formatting, framing, cropping, colour correction, refinement and all sorts of (other) “post-production” activities that are necessary to give the final touch to the product before it is published and marketed.\n\nRedaction is an underestimated but important, final stage in the creative process, allowing the human author many additional creative choices. As the CJEU has explained in Painer, this final phase of the creative process may involve a variety of creative choices.Footnote 84 Indeed, depending on the circumstances, creative choice in the redaction phase may even suffice for a finding of originality of the entire product. For example, in a case involving geographical maps directly created on the basis of unprotected satellite photographs, a French court of appeal held that the maps qualified for copyright protection because they were “the result of personalised implementation of a complex technology by a process of transformation and improvement of choices, in particular colours, contrasts and luminosity”.Footnote 85\n\nWith AI-assisted output this has not fundamentally changed. Even a largely autonomously operating AI system will normally not deliver output that is immediately ready for publication or commercial use. More likely, the output produced by the AI system in the execution phase will require redaction by human actors, especially when it is intended for commercial exploitation. For example, a professional musician using an AI music composer such as AIVA or MuseNet would probably rework and edit output generated by the AI system before finalising the composition.Footnote 86\n\nEven so, not all AI-assisted production will call for extensive redaction. For example, translation machines such as DeepL and Google Translate generate output that is almost ready to use. Nevertheless, here too some human redaction will be required to convert the output into a useful and potentially marketable professional translation. Indeed, DeepL allows its users virtually endless creative freedom in selecting and rephrasing the wording and ordering of each (part of) the translated text.\n\nIn some cases, the redaction role of the human user will be reduced to that of selecting or refusing ready-made output generated by the AI system. This raises an interesting question from a copyright perspective. Clearly, the mere act of selecting may be one of many factors contributing to a finding of originality. But what if selecting one AI output from several is the only choice left to the user? Like many other questions raised by AI, this is not a novel issue.\n\nIn the past, the emergence of non-traditional art forms such as the ready-mades created by conceptualist artists, have triggered similar questions. What is it that elevates a pre-existing artefact such as a prefabricated urinalFootnote 87 or a bicycle wheelFootnote 88 to a work of art – and, by implication, to a work of authorship? According to Swiss copyright scholar Kummer, the decisive creative act here is converting the (in itself unprotectable) idea of a “ready-made” into copyright protected expression by presenting the artefact (the objet trouvé) as a work of art.Footnote 89 Kummer’s “presentation theory” implies that the mere act of selecting a pre-existing object suffices to convert the object into a work. While Kummer’s theory has been embraced by some copyright scholars, it remains controversial.Footnote 90 In any case, personal selection undoubtedly contributes to a finding of originality in AI-assisted output.\n\nAs the preceding discussion reveals, the use of highly advanced AI systems in the production of cultural goods does not imply that human beings have totally surrendered their vital role in the creative process to machines. Whereas the human creator has been partly or largely replaced by the machine at the execution stage of creative production, the human role remains essential at the conception stage, and may have become even more important than before at the redaction stage – given that much AI-assisted output will probably require more redactional work than rough drafts produced by human beings. This leaves both the design choices in the conception phase and the editing and post-production choices in the redaction phase for human authors.\n\nMoreover, it is important to realise that the three-phase creative process described above is simply a model to analyse and explain the authorial choices that contribute to a finding of originality. In reality, the creative process will be iterative. The execution phase will often yield unexpected results that inspire conceptual changes. Redaction may also inspire new ideas that feed back to the conceptual level. In the light of the CJEU’s reasoning in Painer regarding machine-aided creation, which designates both conceptual choices and post-production decisions as relevant factors in the originality analysis, these choices should in many cases be sufficient for a finding of originality in AI-assisted output.Footnote 91\n\nThis conclusion is in line with copyright rules in many national laws that allocate authorship to the person that “masterminds” (conceives) and closely supervises the execution of a work by others, without that person materially contributing to the execution phase of creation.Footnote 92 In the words of Professor Ginsburg, “authorship places mind over muscle: the person who conceptualises and directs the development of the work is the author, rather than the person who simply follows orders to execute the work. Most national copyright laws agree that mere execution does not make one an author. An “author” conceives of the work and supervises or otherwise exercises control over its execution”.Footnote 93\n\nWhile the CJEU has not itself pronounced on the issue of computer-generated productions, there is some case-law at the national level that supports our general conclusion. For example, the Paris court of first instance has held that in the case of “computer-assisted musical composition, when it involves human intervention, the choice of the author [...] leads to the creation of original works”.Footnote 94 In the same vein, the Bordeaux Court of Appeal opined “that a work of the mind created by a computer system can benefit from the rules protecting copyright, provided that it reveals even in a minimal way the originality that its creator wanted to bring”.Footnote 95\n\nStep 4: Expression\nThe fourth part of our four-step test of copyright protection is that the human creator’s creativity be “expressed” in the final production. As previously discussed, we derive from this criterion a prerequisite of general authorial intent: the human author must have a general conception of the work before it is expressed, while leaving room for unintended expressive features.\n\nPrima facie, this requirement might present an obstacle for AI-assisted output. Due to the “black box” characteristic of ML systems, the human author in charge of designing the output in the conception phase will not be able to precisely predict or explain the outcome of the execution phase. This, however, need not rule out “work” status of the final output, if such output stays within the ambit of the author’s general authorial intent. Moreover, even completely unpredicted, non-explainable, quasi-random AI-assisted output might still be converted into a protected “work” in the redaction phase.\n\nWhat “expression” does not require is that courts engage in an assessment of the work’s creative merit, aesthetic value or cultural importance. As the case-law of the CJEU suggests, it is sufficient for a work to be the expression of free creative choices.\n\nBorderline Cases\nThe preceding analysis does not imply that every AI-assisted output will unconditionally qualify as a copyright-protected work under EU copyright standards. Much will depend on the facts and circumstances of a case. While sophisticated art created with the aid of an AI system, such as The Next Rembrandt portrait, will necessarily involve important human creative input at several stages of the creative process, this may not be the case for more mundane AI-assisted output such as weather forecasts and news reports.\n\nIn extreme cases, the AI system will leave its users no meaningful choice beyond pushing a few buttons. Such cases are evident in the domain of natural language generation, such as the GP-T2 and GP-T3 text generators developed by OpenAI.Footnote 96 One spectacular illustration is Talk to Transformer (now InferKit), which automatically completes a text based on a text fragment (prompt) supplied by the user.Footnote 97 Somewhat similar tools are Deep AI’s Text Generation APIFootnote 98 and StoryAI.Footnote 99 Recently, OpenAI has begun to experiment with applying the “transformer” model previously used on text to images, by training it with pixels. In such cases, however, except for the user-generated prompt it will be difficult to identify any creative choice by the human user in the conception, execution or redaction phases. Consequently, any AI-assisted output generated by such systems would probably not qualify as a “work”.\n\nAuthorship of AI Output\nAuthorship in General\n“Work” and “author” are two sides of the same coin. In copyright law, no work exists without an author. Conversely, if there is no work, there will be no author; the question of authorship will only arise if it has been established that there is a work – an intellectual creation – to which authorship can be attributed. In the case of AI-assisted output that does not qualify as a work, no authorship can exist.\n\nThe EU copyright acquis is not instructive on the notion of authorship and relies largely on the Berne Convention.Footnote 100 While the InfoSoc Directive requires Member States to provide rights of reproduction, communication to the public and distribution to “authors”, it does not define this notion. Nevertheless, the CJEU has on various occasions suggested that the notion of “author” is reserved for a human creator, not a legal entity such as a film producer or publisher,Footnote 101 let alone an AI system or a robot.\n\nOnly a few provisions in EU copyright law directly address the issue of authorship.Footnote 102 The Computer Programs Directive enshrines the general principle that the author is the natural person who has created a work. However, it grants the Member States discretion to deviate from this principle in their national laws on computer software, by allowing them to designate a “legal person” (e.g. a company) as the “author” of a computer program.Footnote 103 Various other directives contain rules on the authorship of audio-visual (film) works; the most important of these directives is the Term Directive, which designates the principal director as (co-)author of the work.Footnote 104\n\nMost authorship issues are dealt with by national law. If two or more authors collaborate on creating a work and their individual creative contributions cannot be separated, the ensuing production will be a joint work, with each contributor qualifying as co-author.Footnote 105 Additionally, most national laws will require that the co-authors work according to a common design, making the joint work a “concerted creative effort”.Footnote 106 If only one of the collaborators engages in creative choices, with the other collaborator reduced to the role of “amanuensis”, only the creatively acting person will qualify as author, and no joint authorship will ensue. Some national laws in the EU provide for special rules of authorship allocation in the case of works created following the design and under the supervision of an author.Footnote 107\n\nWho then are the authors of AI-assisted creations? Our analysis will focus on situations where multiple persons have a potential claim to authorship. Potential candidates include the developer or programmer of the AI system and the users of the system. For our authorship analysis, we follow the three-phase model of creativity previously developed: conception, execution and redaction.Footnote 108 As we have seen, in the case of artefacts produced with the aid of AI systems, the conception phase and – in many cases – the redaction phase will entail creative choices by human beings that justify a finding of copyright protection for the AI-assisted output. Authorship in such cases is to be attributed to the person or persons individually or collectively engaging in these creative choices. If more than a single author is involved in the process, and the authors collaborate, this will lead to co-authorship, even if the creative contributions occur at different stages of the creative process. For example, the Dutch Supreme Court has held that a stylist who creatively arranged needlework pieces to be photographed for a magazine was a co-author with the photographer of the resulting photographs.Footnote 109\n\nMuch of the literature on AI and copyright focuses on the scenario of the AI system producing content with only limited input on the part of the user of the system.Footnote 110 If the role of the user of the system is indeed so constricted that they cannot exercise free choice at any stage of the creative process, the user will not qualify as author of the ensuing production. In such cases, the role of the user is essentially reduced to initiating a prompt (e.g. writing an initial sentence) or “pushing buttons”, as in the case of the AI text generation tools discussed above. Here the user’s role is somewhat comparable to that of a person playing a computer game.Footnote 111 For example, authorship of film footage generated by a person playing the popular video game Grand Theft Auto most likely vests in the developers and animators of the video game – not in the player of the game. Even if the player feels empowered and “in control” of whatever transpires on the computer screen, they lack control over the creative process, and their choices do not amount to creative acts justifying a claim of authorship.Footnote 112\n\nAs regards such AI systems, where users are effectively no more than passive “players”, the user clearly does not have a valid claim to authorship in the AI-assisted output (i.e. in anything beyond its initial prompt) – leaving the developer of the AI system as the only candidate for authorship of the AI-assisted output.Footnote 113 Note, however, that a valid authorship claim may only arise if it is established that the output qualifies as a “work” in the first place. In the case of AI text generation tools such a finding, however, seems unlikely. The text generated by the AI system was not preconceived by the designer of the system, nor is it creatively redacted. At best one could argue that the output text is an adaptation (transformation) of the text the user input, of which the user (not the developer) is the author.\n\nValid authorship or co-authorship claims by developers of AI systems are likely to arise primarily in situations where developers and users collaborate on AI output. The Next Rembrandt project is a good example: the painting that the project eventually produced was the result of close collaboration between AI developers, engineers, and art historians, jointly creating a work of authorship.Footnote 114 If the AI system developer played a creative role in the process, they clearly deserve co-authorship status.\n\nIn many if not most cases, however, the developers of AI systems will not collaborate in a material way with the users on generating specific output.Footnote 115 For example, providers of general-purpose AI systems or services will provide users with access to their general AI capabilities, without being involved or having knowledge of the specific output to be created with the aid of their systems. In such cases, instances of (co-)authorship by AI system developers are unlikely to materialise, since, under prevailing copyright doctrine, co-authorship can only arise if the work is the result of a “concerted creative effort”, i.e. if multiple authors collaborate according to a common plan to create a specific work.\n\nMoreover, co-authorship claims by AI developers will also be unlikely for obvious commercial reasons. A developer claiming authorship (or co-ownership) of output generated with the aid of its system would probably not attract many customers. Assuming that AI systems will eventually become standard services or tools in the hands of business or commercial users and individual creators (similar to, e.g., Photoshop or Garage Band), the contractual terms of use of the AI system will probably resolve and preclude any such (co-)authorship claims.Footnote 116 Indeed, the terms of use of the popular DeepL AI-powered translation service expressly disclaim any authorship or copyright in relation to content produced by its users with the aid of DeepL.Footnote 117\n\nIn the EU, allocating authorship to developers of AI systems may be further complicated by the divergent treatment of computer programs, databases and other creative content.Footnote 118 Like computer games, AI systems that generate audio-visual content are a mix of computer software, databases and (in some cases) audio-visual works. The authorship of the component parts (software, databases, other works) will rarely coalesce in a single author. It may therefore be problematic to establish (co-)authorship of the output generated by the system in those cases where the AI developer has a valid claim to (co-)authorship, that is, when the developer and the user of the AI system collaborate in producing creative output.\n\nPresumption of Authorship\nProving or enforcing authorship or copyright ownership of a work may sometimes be difficult in practice. For this reason, many Member States provide for rules that establish a (rebuttable) presumption of authorship or copyright ownership, in that the person indicated on or with the published work as the author is deemed to be the author, unless proven otherwise. The Berne Convention and the Enforcement Directive validate such legal presumptions and allow the person whose name “appear[s] on the work in the usual manner” to instigate infringement procedures.Footnote 119\n\nWhile these rules are intended to facilitate proof of authorship and ownership, they might in practice be abused to disguise the absence of human authorship by falsely attributing AI-assisted output to a natural person. The issue has been flagged in the literature,Footnote 120 but it remains unclear whether it will amount to a serious problem in practice.\n\nNote that falsely claiming copyright protection – also known as “copyfraud”Footnote 121 – is already a well-known, and growing, problem outside the domain of AI.Footnote 122 The problem is exacerbated by the rise of “copyright trolls” that extort content providers on platforms such as YouTube by threatening to trigger the notice-and-take-down procedures that these platforms (automatically) apply.Footnote 123 In the United States, the fraudulent use of copyright notice is criminally punishable under the U.S. Copyright Act.Footnote 124 In most EU Member States, there are no similar provisions; nor does the EU Enforcement Directive deal with fraudulent authorship claims.Footnote 125\n\nBritish and Irish Rules on Copyright Protection of Computer-Generated Works\nIn some copyright laws of the British tradition – including in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa – the requirement of human authorship has been circumvented by establishing the authorship of “computer-generated works” in cases where no human authorship can be established.Footnote 126 Under these regimes, authorship – and by implication copyright ownership – is accorded to the person who undertook the arrangements necessary for its creation.\n\nFor example, the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 of Ireland defines “computer-generated”, in relation to a work, as meaning “that the work is generated by computer in circumstances where the author of the work is not an individual”.Footnote 127 The Irish Act proceeds to define as “author”, “(f) in the case of a work which is computer-generated, the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken”.Footnote 128\n\nThe UK provisions that inspired the Irish regime are similar, but not identical.Footnote 129 If the existence of a “work” is conditional upon human authorship, this statutory language seems to suggest that the British and Irish regimes attribute authorship to output that would not qualify as an original “work” according to EU copyright law standards. Whether that is, indeed, the correct reading of these provisions, is, however, still unclear. Since the introduction of the regime on computer-generated works in UK law in 1988, this has led to just a single court decision, which has not clarified this issue.Footnote 130\n\nIf the British regime indeed protects “authorless” computer-generated works, this would imply that AI-assisted output that does not meet the standard of originality (and therefore is without an “author”) could nonetheless be accorded copyright protection under UK and Irish law, with the producer (“the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken”) as its author and copyright owner. Not surprisingly, the British and Irish regimes have been criticised as being incompatible with EU copyright standards.Footnote 131 Indeed, a national rule that accords copyright protection to subject matter that does not meet the standard of “the author’s own intellectual creation” is hard to reconcile with CJEU case-law that implies that the notion of a “work” is fully harmonised and therefore does not allow national laws to accord copyright protection under more lenient conditions.Footnote 132\n\nConclusions\nAs our inquiry into EU copyright law reveals, four interrelated criteria are to be met for AI-assisted output to qualify as a protected “work”: the output is (1) in relation to “production in the literary, scientific or artistic domain”; (2) the product of human intellectual effort; and (3) the result of creative choices that are (4) “expressed” in the output. Whether the first step is established EU law is uncertain. Since most AI artefacts belong to the “literary, scientific or artistic domain” anyway, and are the result of at least some “human intellectual effort”, however remote, in practice the focus of the copyright analysis is on steps 3 and 4.\n\nBased on an analysis of the CJEU’s case-law, we conclude that the core issue is whether the AI-assisted output is the result of human creative choices that are “expressed” in the output. In line with the Court’s reasoning in the Painer case, we distinguish three distinct phases of the creative process in AI-assisted production: “conception” (design and specifications), “execution” (producing draft versions) and “redaction” (selecting, editing, refinement, finalisation).\n\nWhile AI systems play a dominant role in the execution phase, the role of human authors at the conception stage often remains essential. Moreover, in many instances, human beings will also oversee the redaction stage. Depending on the facts of the case, this will allow human beings sufficient overall creative choice. Assuming these choices are expressed in the final AI-assisted output, the output will then qualify as a copyright-protected work. By contrast, if an AI system is programmed to automatically execute content without the output being conceived or redacted by a person exercising creative choices, there will be no “work”.\n\nDue to the “black box” nature of some AI systems, persons in charge of the conception phase will sometimes not be able to precisely predict or explain the outcome of the execution phase. But this does not present an obstacle to the “work” status of the final output if that output stays within the ambit of the person’s general authorial intent.\n\nAuthorship status will be accorded to the person or persons that have creatively contributed to the output. In most cases this will be the user of the AI system, not the AI system developer, unless the developer and user collaborate on a specific AI production, in which case there will be co-authorship. If “off-the-shelf” AI systems are used to create content, co-authorship claims by AI developers will also be unlikely for merely commercial reasons, since AI developers will normally not want to burden customers with downstream copyright claims. We therefore expect this issue to be clarified in the contractual terms of service of providers of such systems.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that the EU copyright framework is generally suitable and sufficiently flexible to deal with the current challenges posed by AI-assisted creation. Producers of AI-assisted output will in many cases enjoy copyright protection. Moreover, “authorless” AI output might still qualify for protection against misappropriation under less demanding IP regimes, such as neighbouring rights and sui generis database protection,Footnote 133 or other doctrines such as trade secrets and unfair competition.Footnote 134 In this light, regulatory intervention to extend copyright protection beyond the current EU rules would be justified only if solid empirical economic analysis were to reveal that the absence of protection harms overall economic welfare in the EU.\n\n"}]}

exciting panel I'm going to\nintroduce the participants and then hand it over to our expert moderator so these are the rock stars from\nLivermore who\nI'm going to tell you everything you ever wanted to know about what happened last Monday and Beyond\nuh first we have Alex zylstra who was the principal experimentalist for this experiment\nAnnie cricher the principal designer and team lead for integrated modeling then we have Jean-Michel de Nicola who's the\nchief engineer for the lit nif laser system Michael staderman Target fabrication\nprogram manager and then artpack the team lead for stagnation science and the lead for\nDiagnostics on this experiment and Tammy ma who's the lead for Lawrence\nlivermore's inertial Fusion Energy institutional initiative and now to moderate the panel I'm going\nto hand the mic over to Mark Herman who's our program director for weapons physics and design and long time Fusion guy\nall right well uh thanks we're going to talk uh\nsome more about uh today's exciting announcement an inertial confinement Fusion experiment\nthat yielded more energy infusion than we input with the laser we got out 3.15\nmegajoules we put in 2.05 megajoules in the laser that's never been done before\nin any Fusion laboratory anywhere in the world so it's super exciting and uh this\nteam and the many many hundreds of colleagues back at Lawrence Livermore uh are really pumped about that um\nI want to be clear ultimately this experiment as Kim mentioned uh Drew about 300 megajoules from the Grid in\norder to fire the laser the laser wasn't designed to be efficient the laser was designed to give us as much juice as\npossible to make this incredible uh conditions uh possible happen basically\nin the laboratory so there are many many steps that would\nhave to be made in order to get to inertial Fusion as an energy source\nso in this experiment um we use the world's most energetic\nlaser the national ignition facility uh to create x-rays that cause a tiny\ncapsule to implode and create a very hot very high pressure\nplasma and that plasma um wants to immediately lose its energy\nit wants to blow apart it wants to radiate it's looking for ways to cool down\nbut the fusion reactions are depositing heat in that plasma causing it to heat\nup right so there's a race between Heating and Cooling and if the plasma gets a little bit\nhotter the fusion reaction rate goes up creating even more fusions which gets\neven more Heating and uh and so the question is can we win the race\nand for many many decades we lost the race um uh that we got more cooling out then\nwe got the heating up and so we didn't get to this uh ignition event but last\nMonday that all changed and we able we're able to win the race and get a\nvery significant uh heating of the fusion plasma up to very high temperatures which resulted in that\nyield of 3.15 megajoules we studied Fusion ignition to keep our\nnuclear deterrent safe secure effective and reliable uh and and do so without the need for\nfurther underground nuclear weapons testing Fusion ignition is a key process in our thermonuclear weapons\nin addition this The Very extreme environments created when the fusion plasma ignites enables testing\nthat ensures we can maintain and modernize our nuclear deterrent\nwe hope that someday and we'll talk some more about this Fusion could provide a base load carbon-free source of energy\nto power our planet so I'm very delighted to be on stage with several representatives of the incredible\nincredible team that that made this possible and now we're going to hear more from our panel of experts and we're\ngoing to start with Alex good morning my name is Alex zylstra I was the principal experimentalist for\nthe shot that we're discussing in the campaign that led up to it and so I'm here on behalf of the experimental team\nas Mark said nif is the most energetic laser facility in the world is where we conduct these experiments\nwe take the laser energy and convert it into x-rays so we need to decide how that process will work use those x-rays\nto compress the capsule that contains the fuel if we can compress the fuel by a factor\nof more than ten thousand it reaches densities temperatures and pressures that are higher than the center of the\nSun and that's what's required for our approach to Fusion to work\nso the job of the experimental team is to put all the pieces together and ensure that nothing goes wrong that\nactually starts months earlier for a shot we begin working with the design team to decide on a concept that we want\nto test once that's decided then we work with our colleagues in Target fabrication and\nthe laser science in order to bring those pieces of the experiment in and then a few days before the shot it's\nhanded off to the operations Crews on the facility we work with them to actually execute the experiment because\nthey're the ones who are actually Hands-On in the facility making this a reality the shot goes off it takes only a few\nbillionths of a second and so we need an Exquisite Suite of Diagnostics to measure what happened\nand with those measurements we can then increase our understanding of the particular experiment\nI want to emphasize that each experiment we do is building on 60 years of work in this field and more\nthan a decade on nif itself so we use that previous understanding in\norder to field design or experiments each experiment then contributes to the\noverall knowledge both these main Fusion ignition shots and also experiments that we do with specialized configurations\nand specialized Diagnostics all building the understanding that allows us to make progress\nall that work led up to a moment just after 1am last Monday when we took a\nshot and we started to see um\nhopefully that's uh not representative but we took a shot just after 1am last\nMonday and as the data started to come in we saw the first indications that we had produced more Fusion energy than the\nlaser input and so I'm very excited to be here on behalf of the experimental team and with my colleagues on behalf of\nthe entire nif team to discuss it with you um so good good morning I'm Annie\nkreitzer I'm the principal designer for the experiment and the campaign and also team lead for integrated modeling of\nthese experiments and I'm here to represent the entire design team so the role of a designer is to define the\ninput conditions to the experiment to achieve the desired plasma conditions\nand that includes the target geometry Dimensions materials Etc as well as a\nlaser pulse so we don't just smack the target with all the laser energy all at once we define various specific Powers\nat very specific times to achieve the desired conditions and we do this using\na variety of tools including complex plasma physics simulations analytical\nmodels and we Benchmark them against experimental data um so the ultimate goal as Alex\nmentioned is to create a design that can reach the extreme conditions required\nfor Fusion ignition on a nif and in doing so we were able to reach pressures more than two times the center of the\nsun on the last experiment and about 150 million degrees and this requires a great deal of\nfinesse and design optimization to reach these conditions as well as continual learning over the many years of designs\nand results that we've collected at nif and specifically there were two design\nchanges that were made leading up to the most recent result that fed into it so\nthis most recent result is part of a new campaign or a new effort to make use of\nthe new laser capability that JM will talk about next and that is making the\ncapsule that holds the Fusion fuel a little bit thicker and that does two things that gives us more margin for\nachieving ignition when we have non-optimal Fielding conditions as well\nas it lets us burn up more of the DT Fusion fuel so the first experiment in this campaign was performed in September\nand the the experiment we're talking about today made intentional design changes from the September shot also to\nimprove the symmetry of the implosion and with that I'm happy to be here and\nto take questions and very excited about our team's work on this\nall right good morning I'm Jean-Michel de Nicola chief engineer for nif laser systems I'm representing the team of\ntechnician engineer and scientists who design build operate and improve this\nunique little facility and together our team is standing on the\nshoulder of multiple generation of optical material and Laser physicists who design and optimized ever increasing\nperformance in terms of the laser delivery following the seminal paper from John Nichols Livermore who\nbasically lay down the concept for nuclear fusion using lasers\nhowever we also want to acknowledge numerous collaborators and other\nNational Labs University industry as well as International partners and of\ncourse continued support from doe and NSA in Congress for this Mission so important for National Security\nthanks to outstanding science and technology and our team Livermore with collaborator made the impossible\npossible the knife laser is the largest laser in the world it has the size of three football fields\nand it delivers an energy in excess of 2 million joules with a peak power of 500\ntrillion Watts for a very short amount of time we are talking only about a few billionth of a\nsecond it exceeds the entire grid U.S power grid\num the laser however achieving the ignition however requires more than\nBrute Force as any described there are extremely fine tunings that needs to be performed to match the condition for\nignition Precision has been our Focus for the last few years and we have been\ndelivering more symmetric implosion and more reproducible experiments\nand in addition thanks to the continue investment from the nation we have been able to deliver eight percent more\nenergy on the experiments last week compared to the one last year\num it it goes along with additional efforts that will be brought during the summer\nand in Us in next summer we'll be able to design experiments and field shots\nwith additional eight percent of laser energy providing more margins for ignition\nin the future with a sustainment and upgrade investment the new laser could produce even higher energies and Power\nand give the promise to larger Target gains that would be enabling additional\nextreme conditions for science-based stockpile stewardship program and maintain the United States of America\nleadership in this field I'll pass it over to Michael morning I am Michael staterman I am the\nprogram manager for Target fabrication at Livermore I'm here to present a team of over 100 members that is responsible\nfor making almost all Targets shot on nif and that comprises members of general atomics of diamond materials in\nGermany and of Lawrence Livermore the most important component that we deliver for Fusion targets is the fuel\ncapsule fuel capsule is a BB Point sized shell made of diamond that needs to be\nas perfect as possible we've been working over the last 16 years on continuously improving the quality of\nthese shells to get to the state where we are today and in turn that effort has\nbeen based on Decades of Prior capsule development activities that have been done at Livermore elsewhere\ntoday's shells are almost perfectly round they're 100 times smoother than a mirror and they have a tiny tube\nattached to them that's about a 50th the diameter of a hair through which the fuel is filled into\nthe shell as you can imagine Perfection is really hard and so we've yet to get there we\nstill have tiny flaws on our shells smaller than bacteria that could be refilled for example Pits on the surface\nor holes in the wall despite their small size these flaws still have the potential to affect the\nexperiment so not only do we make the shells but we also characterize the shells and make sure and share the\nresults with our colleagues so that we can select the best shell for each experiment how strongly an experiment is affected\nby the flaws depends on the design input that Annie was talking about and it looks like the result from Monday\nis a more robust design that is less affected this is very encouraging for us because we know that the shell that we\nshot had flaws in it and this gives us confidence that we can make shells of equal quality even better quality in the\nfuture that will be able to reproduce this experiment or even improve on it yeah so with that I'll pass it on target\nthanks my name is Arthur pack I'm the team lead for stagnation science which\nis really focused on trying to understand how to create the conditions to achieve ignition at the nif\nso I'm responsible for coordinating the portfolio of integrated experiments so it's been pursuing ignition as well as\noverseeing the analysis groups that take these observations we get from the experiments and try to understand the\nconditions of the fusion plasma and this has been really critically important to understand these conditions as I'll talk\nabout and it's really been enabled by sort of state-of-the-art Diagnostics Optical x-ray nuclear Diagnostics that\nhave been developed over Decades of work by an exceptional team of Engineers and\nscientists from Lawrence Livermore and from other National Laboratories in the U.S the UK and France in addition with\nmajor contributions from our domestic and international academic and Industry\npartners so for each experiment we field over 50 scientific measurements to diagnose key\nquantities of the reacting fusion plasma such as the temperature the Fusion Energy yield the duration over which\nthis occurs and to give you a sense of scale and just how remarkable these you know these\nthese Diagnostics are the plasma we're trying to measure is uh is a tenth of a millimeter in diameter so that's the\nthickness of a strand or two of human hair as was mentioned the temperatures\nof these plasmas are over 100 million degrees so that's 10 times hotter than the center of the sun and the entire\nreactions occur in a fraction of a nanosecond so that's about a billion times faster than you can blink your eye\nand then as Alex mentioned we're only able to get these great measurements due to the sort of tireless work of\ntechnicians and operators who field them at the facility and and allow us to get\nthese these these amazing observations to help us understand what's going on and these observations have been really\ncritical for our progress so they've they've helped to identify quantify and\nmitigate degradations or loss mechanisms which have impeded our progress they\nallow us to test hypotheses and design changes to understand what are the\nsensitivities of the system and so I'm here today on behalf of these diagnostic\ngroups to help answer any questions and talk about what we can learn from these\nexperiments thanks good morning my name is Tammy Ma and I\nam the lead for the Lawrence Livermore institutional initiative in inertial Fusion Energy or what we call Ife\ndeveloping an economically attractive approach to Fusion Energy is a grand scientific and engineering challenge\nwithout a doubt it will be a Monumental undertaking however the potential benefits are\nenormous clean carbon free abundance\nreliable energy capable of meeting the world's energy demands and furthermore providing for the energy sovereignty and\nenergy security of the U.S as the secretary mentioned earlier today\nthis spring the White House hosted a summit announcing a bold decadal vision for\nFusion Energy building on great advances we had in both inertial and magnetic\nconfinement Fusion these recent results on the nif are the first time in a laboratory anywhere on\nEarth we were able to demonstrate more energy coming out of a fusion reaction than was put in\nthis lays the groundwork it is it demonstrates the basic scientific feasibility of inertial Fusion Energy\nand sets the road map for us to move forward to even higher gains and towards Fusion pilot plants in the coming\ndecades the department of energy office of Fusion Energy Sciences recently\ncommissioned a basic research needs report in inertial Fusion Energy\nthis report will help lay out the framework for a new Ife program here in\nthe U.S and that report should be coming out imminently such a program will inevitably\ninevitably require participation from across the community both the public\nsector but the private sector as well so of course new Fusion startup companies\ntheir investors National Labs universities Academia public utilities\nand more we look forward to working with the Department of energy to leverage and\ncapitalize on these great results for a Fusion Energy Future time is now\nand I will hand it back to mark thanks Tim\num so we're going to ask each each panelist a question here and then we'll open it up to the floor\num Annie this experiment improved on on an experiment as you mentioned that we had done in September of 2022 and it was\na modified design from the one in August of 2021 can you explain how you used physics\ninsights and simulations to make changes in the design for this recent experiment\nsimulations to design many aspects of our implosions however we know that there's areas of parameter space where\nwe might not be as predictive so we have developed Playbook experimental playbooks and analytical models and I\nused a combination our design team used a combination of both to make the adjustment from September going into\nthis latest experiment there was two sort of different flavors of symmetry\nadjustments that were made one is during sort of the second half of the laser time history and one is during the first\nhalf of the laser time history during the second half of the laser time history we transferred more energy\nbetween laser beams to control the symmetry so that's actually quite a useful tool and if you haven't heard\nabout it it's really awesome you can move energy between beams and control symmetry that way in doing so you have\nto go back and re-adjust the Symmetry during the first half of the laser pulse and we did that but we also did that\nmaking an additional adjustment with improved models Based on data that were\ncollected just in the last few months so in that piece we really do rely on our models to Benchmark against tuning data\nand then extrapolate out to the design space and just for perspective we're\ntalking about compressing something the size of a basketball down to the size of a key controlling that compression\nsymmetry to about one percent in in drive and also the final symmetry to\njust a few percent so it's quite a challenging problem and we have great tools to get there\nthanks Annie uh John Michelle for many years the maximum laser energy on nif was 1.9\nmegajoules but in this experiment you turn the laser up to 2.05 megajoules\nhow did you and your team make sure that this would be safe to operate the laser\nat these higher higher laser Energies thank you Mark first of all I would like to point out that the national ignition\nfacility is one of the first generation of the inertial confinement Fusion to\nmeet and exceed its requirement so it's uh it's by itself quite a Grand\nChallenge to do that because those laser architectures are extremely complex and are Marvel of engineering and Laser\nphysics and nonlinear Optics um second uh since the commissioning of the national ignition facility we have\ncontinuously increased the energy and power over you know a few years to make\nsure that we were obtaining the regime where ignition experiment could take place in favorable conditions in\nparallel there was a tremendous amount of investment in terms of Optics Science and Technology as well as laser physics\nto have Optics that would be higher performance compared to the previous generation and we gained orders of\nmagnitude compared to previous generation no questions about it we perform also a lot of work trying to\ncontrol the the shape of the laser in space and time to make sure we can\ntransmit the maximum throughput through the Optics with maximum reliability last\nbut not least we also figured out that some of the debris are migrating back\ninto the laser from the target experiment and ignition when it takes place debris are transported back you\nknow near the Optics and you know Finding and mitigating those debris sources was also a key instrument so\nvery minor modification to the laser architecture and and we published a paper in 2019 in nuclear fusion if you\nwant more detail about that thanks Jim uh Alex many many elements\nhave to come together to enable a successful nif experiment we need a good Target a cryogenic ice layer we need the\nlasers to be specified and we need to make sure the Diagnostics are going to be taking pictures at the right time so\nhow did you prepare for this experiment knowing it had the potential to be a really exciting shot\nyeah so one of the things that's so challenging with these experiments is that any one thing going wrong can be\nenough to prevent ignition so everything has to be right and so we really have to sweat the small stuff\nto kind of give you a sense for that Annie discussed our tuning of the symmetry we had a debate over a laser\nsetting equivalent to five trillionths of a meter going into this experiment we had a discussion with the laser science\nteam over timing discrepancies of 25 trillionths of a second\nwith the target each Target we look at all of the flaws that Michael was describing that are the size of a\nbacteria to decide if they're acceptable or not they then grow a cryogenic DTI Slayer\nwhich has the same sorts of requirements bacteria size defects can be problematic\nand then we're setting up the Diagnostics where small timing errors you know a billionth of a second would\nbe an eternity for us in this experiment we're trying to image something that's the brightest thing on Earth for 100\ntrillionths of a second and so getting all that right is a team effort going through an intense review\nprocess thanks art how do we know this experiment\npassed the threshold of ignition and got more Fusion Energy out than laser energy in\nfor the first time in history yeah thanks so um in these experiments\nwe use deuterium and tritium as our Fusion fuel which are isotopes of hydrogen\nand when these two ions fuse they release a helium ion or an alpha\nparticle and a neutron and they're released with a very well-known energies now the alpha particle it stays in the\nplasma further heating it leading to more Fusion reactions while the neutrons largely escape and so if we can measure\nthe number of escaping neutrons then we know how many reactions took place and then we just multiply the number of\nreactions by the energy released for each fusion and that's how we measure the Fusion Energy so in this experiment\nto get a Target gain one we used 2.05 megajoules of laser energy so to exceed\none we need to make at least that much Fusion Energy so the way we we measure the number of\nneutrons we do that multiple ways using independent Diagnostics but one of the methods we use is to place a high Purity\nmetal sample close to the to the reactions that gets irradiated by the\nescaping neutrons and becomes Radioactive so the unstable States in\nthis foil will then Decay and because we know very well the rate of activation\nand Decay we can then measure how many neutrons went through that foil and what\nthe total number of neutrons were and how much Fusion Energy was released we have other methods so another\nindependent method is to turn the escaping neutrons into a Charged particle Spectrum disperse that using a\nmagnetic spectrometer and sweep that on to a piece of film and so we can\nactually measure the number of sort of incident neutrons directly so all these\ndifferent methods give us a very very high confidence that we produced 3.15\nmegajoules of Fusion Energy which corresponds to a gain of roughly one and a half so that's how we know\nthanks sir so Michael you talked about the targets they were incredible marvels of\nengineering and Manufacturing can you briefly describe how you've been working to actually make them even better the\nthin spherical diamond shells that contain the Fusion fuel sure Mark so the main thing the main problem that we have\nright now with getting perfect capsules are small flaws and so to be able to improve on the\nflaws the first thing that we have to be able to do is actually see them measure them count them and quantify how many of\nthe flaws are on a shell the primary tool that we use today to characterize a shell is computer x-ray\ntomography extratermography generates a lot of data and in the past it is required trained\nexperts a lot of time to go through these images and basically find the needle in the haystack\nso now what we're working on is software that helps us in this process and hopefully will be more accurate than a\nhuman in the longer run that will help us quantify exactly to see how many flaws there are how many how big they\nare and whether when we're making a change to the deposition to the fabrication process where that actually\nimproves the number of flaws in their size so that's the characterization part on\nthe actual Improvement of the material we are working very closely with our collaborators in Germany at Dime materials to look at the fabrication\nconditions we're working as a team using the others capabilities as a reference\nto our own so that we can isolate the problem to machine operation or surroundings and this process has been\nvery fruitful for narrowing down a set of conditions that has allowed us to improve the target Beyond where we are\ntoday thanks Michael okay Tammy um so to power the laser for\nthis experiment the two to get that 2.05 megajoules we had to pull about 300\nmegajoules from the grid um and and then we got out 3.15 megajoules of Fusion Energy right so so\nwhy do we think it's possible to turn this into an energy source in the future\nit's a great question thank you Mark the nif is a scientific demonstration\nfacility and when we built the nif the considerations that you have to build that facility are a little bit different\nthan if you're going to build a fusion power plant so for example maximizing\nthe efficiency of every single component is not necessarily the most important thing and so for example the wall plug\nefficiency of the laser was not necessarily a very important requirement for this science facility\nhowever as Kim alluded to the beniff is now over 20 years old and the technology\ninside the nif is 80s 90s technology and things of progressed quite a lot since\nthen we have new laser architectures that can not only run at rep rate but are far more efficient up to something\naround 20 wall plug efficiency there's also been enormous advancements in\nTarget fabrication new materials computation and simulations the\napplication of machine learning so it's a really exciting time because we get to incorporate all of these emerging\nTechnologies with this new scientific understanding that we've developed to really push towards inertial Fusion\nEnergy and I'll also note perseverance it took us to get here as\nhas been mentioned it's been 60 years since ignition was first dreamed of using lasers and it's really a testament\nto the perseverance dedication of the folks that made this happen it also means we have the perseverance\nto get diffusion energy on the grid thanks Tim and thanks panel and then now\nwe're going to open it up to questions I know\na round of applause for our panelists\ntesting all right hi everybody I'm nnsa public affairs deputy director Shyla\nHassan I want to thank those of you who stayed for this more technical discussion with the folks that actually made this happen\num it's a very exciting day for nnsa so we're going to start the Q a portion we have a little bit more time uh with\nmedia so if there are any media folks who came late and need to move up this is where we have media seated just to\nmake sure you get your questions in and my colleague Jeremy will be there on the other side to get a mic if you're a\nlittle too far and feel like you need to reach so if you could please state your name and your outlet before your question otherwise I will remind you\nhey it's Ariana from Bloomberg uh what was the cost of the targets you're using uh and also what fraction of the Fusion\nfuel was actually converted to energy during the shot thank you I'm going to take the uh I'm happy to\njump in Michael you want to um I think the way to think of the targets is how long does it take for someone to build\nthem right because the predominant cost is the the labor of the people um and so they take months to build\nright uh well a few so the the components that comprise a Target take a\nvariety of different times to make the actual assembly of the Target only takes about two weeks to make the fuel Council\never makes it takes seven months from the Inception of what you want to the delivery of the capsule\num the targets that we are using today are designed for science right they're designed to be flexible so that we can\nreconfigure them as we want to learn different things and they're designed to be able to see what's going on\nso these targets are not designed for a Fusion Energy\nno I don't think it's it's kind of like we're sized we have a staff that can produce the targets we need per year for\non nif and so uh it's really about a Workforce more than a dollars per Target\nthe components the actual amount of gold or carbon or whatever are actually really\nreally cheap right I mean the the actual cost of the materials and the targets is next to nothing it's it's all the labor\nthat goes into it that makes it uh um time consuming to answer the second part of your\nquestion it was about four percent of the DT that was burned on the shot\nwell thanks I I often talk about how special the National Laboratories\nare because we do team science and there's no better example of that\nthan what we just heard from you but I'm guessing maybe you didn't come expecting\nto do exactly what just happened so I'd be very interested in just like short stories about Why'd You Come and why do\nyou stay uh at the lab thank you I think I can I can give a quick answer\nto that so I actually toured nif while it was under construction as an undergraduate and so seeing the scale of\nwhat was possible at the National Laboratories um is what drew me in as well as being able\nto see you know the ability to do great science that has an actual impact on National Security and energy\napplications and so yeah I hope that anyone watching who's inspired by this current moment comes to work with us in\nthe future and take this to the next level yeah and I actually have a very similar\nstory so you might notice a trend here I came as an undergraduate in 2004 and I\nsaw nif and I thought this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be part of this large interdisciplinary teams\nworking together Grand Challenge and problems that move Humanity forward and\nare so important for the nation also it's just fun to tell your friends you shoot big losers and my dad really liked\nit as well so all right we've got one question over\nhere hi Michael greschko National Geographic\nthank you all for being here and congratulations um what time on December 5th did the\nshot occur and for each of you in the minutes and hours after that how did you\nfirst learn that this shot was special\nI can start with that so the shot went off I believe at 103 a.m last Monday\num and so I was up to look at the data and as the data started to come in we started to see some you know indications\nthat this had happened and one of the first things I did was call one of the diagnostic experts to to double check\nthe data and we kind of went from there\nso I had vivid dreams of all possible outcomes from the shot and this always\nhappens before a shot from like complete success to utter failure and then I woke\nup thankfully Alex had sent me a message so by the time I woke up I saw that it wasn't a failure and um and then of\ncourse I start emailing you're texting you right away and um yeah so just amazing feeling of you\nstart looking at you see one Diagnostic and you think well maybe that's not real and then you start to see more and more\nDiagnostics rolling in pointing to the same thing and it's just a great feeling\nso for the laser team the the work started earlier in the night because we had to check and make sure during the\npreparation stages of the experiment were on track to a successful delivery so numerous phone calls emails checking\nof the results real time giving the green light to proceed and then the\nrelief when we see the result in the laser didn't screw up the experiment that was relief number one and then we\nstart to receive the text with potential yields and that's uh you know Eureka and Euro movements\nwell for Target fabrication our work usually ends somewhere about a week before the shot when we deliver the\ntarget to the facility we had high hopes for this one so I was checking email as soon as I woke up to see how the shot\ndid and was very excited about the numbers that I saw yeah so um as Annie mentioned\num we're building off of Prior experiments and um you know we had a good reason to be\noptimistic for this experiment so I was very keyed in and curious\num but as I started going later and later I you know I gotta get the kids up in the morning so I was like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna go to bed but uh I woke\nup at three in the morning just out of sleep and I went to check my email and I saw the number and of course I I done\nthe math before the experiment so I knew what number I I wanted to see for getting greater than one and so the\npreliminary data came out and I was like holy smokes so that's how I sort of and then I went back to bed or tried to go\nback to bed which was um I actually didn't find out until the\nnext morning I was at the airport at SFO about to board a plane to come to DC actually to attend the fusion power\nAssociates meeting which is an annual meeting where we have Fusion leaders coming together to really work together\non how to push forward Fusion Energy but anyways I got I got a call from my boss\nsaying I think we got ignition and I uh I burst into tears\nand I was jumping up and down in the waiting area the crazy person\num and uh yeah the tears were streaming down my face after all these years every\ntime I walk into the national ignition facility I still get goosebumps and so it is a wonderful place to work and I'm\nso proud of this team thank you all\nJames Reardon Science News Magazine it since the ignition uh the prior one that\nwas an important event have there been events like this that have been failures that have been disappointments and why\non Earth would you do it at 1am is there a technical reason\nyeah so um you know following uh last last year's experiment we tried to\nrepeat that Experiment three or four times and what we learned from those\nexperiments was that this design was still very sensitive to the Target\ndefects that were present and so we were able to quantify the impact and understand you\nknow the origin of these defects and so knowing that we we went for improved\ndesigns to make ourselves more robust we use that knowledge to try to pick the best capsules to minimize the impact and\nso um you know that that's why what led us to to this to this event here and why\n1am so nif runs 24 7 so to grow these\nice layers it's a multi-day process and so it's not fully deterministic so\nyou'll try it will fail you'll try to grow again and so it just happens that the shot cycle goes that way and that we\ntake the shot when we're ready to take the shot so\nuh James Osborne Houston Chronicle um there's two Tech you know two Fusion\nTechnologies magnetic confinement and inertial um does this can you sort of explain\nwhere your breakthrough does that does that sort of put inertial\nat the Forefront now is that is that the technology you know Society is going to pursue or does it have implications for\nmagnetic that you know might allow that to continue um I think it was implied earlier that\nmagnet had sort of seen more advances of late um obviously though this is the big breakthrough so if somebody could sort\nof explain that thank you yeah absolutely um there's there's definitely pros and cons for each different approach\num and there's different technology developments that need to occur and so\nuh both magnetic fusion and inertial have made great advances in the past\ncouple of years there's also been enormous private sector investment actually more on the magnetic side than\nthe inertial side in recent years I think what we've been able to\ndemonstrate on the nif is a burning plasma we've gotten gain however like\nKim alluded to we're a little bit farther behind in some of the technology developments\nbecause that's just not what we've been focused on the past few years that being said there's a lot of different\ncommonalities there's a lot of commonalities between the two where we can learn from each other there's a\nburning plasma physics Materials Science reactor engineering and we're very\nsupportive of each other in this community Unity a win for either inertial or magnetic confinement is a\nwin for all of us and we really just want to see Fusion Energy happen and the point is though that there are\ndifferent technological risks for both of them right now Fusion is so\nincredibly impactful and important for humankind that what we really want to do\nis maximize the potential Pathways to success so we want to carry these different approaches and and see what\nwill really work\nuh people are within it with any news uh could you give us your vision of what a\ncommercial Fusion plan would look like using this technology\njumped ahead a couple of decades what what uh what might this uh\nproduction of energy look like um so right now there are a number of\ndifferent approaches to Target physics that could actually get\nus to High Gain high margin all of those have slightly different drivers so for\nwhat we're doing on the nif we use high energy lasers but there are designs using heavy ions\npulse power Etc et cetera and there's been a number of different\nintegrated studies to try to pull all of this together really where we are right\nnow is at a Divergent Point we've been very lucky to be able to leverage the work that the nnsa has done for inertial\nconfinement Fusion but if we want to get serious about Ife we are at a point\nwhere we need to invest in those Technologies we need to figure out what that integrated system looks like\nbecause the target like like Michael said is complex it takes a long time to\nbuild um and what we need for a power plant it has to be simple it has to be high\nvolume it needs to be robust and there are trade-offs if you can get to higher\ngain with your target you can turn down your laser energy or your laser efficiency a little bit there are\ndecisions to be made about the materials that you would use for your reactor those would impact Your Design as well\nso what we're doing now with the Department of energy is actually embarking on doing these integrated\nsystem studies again with our best known information about technology as it's\nevolved today and to figure out where the the biggest gaps are where we need to invest where we need to buy down risk\nand that will be an ongoing owing activity for for quite a few years but\nwith this bold decadal Vision we are really trying to accelerate and put together these designs to see what is\nthe the most viable feasible design and all come together to work on it\nhi Dave netzer Pierre fed scoop uh the director mentioned earlier that machine learning played a key role in sort of\nthe in-between between the thresh reaching the threshold to ignition and then this latest test so I'm curious how\nI have advances in machine learning and Computing helped you in your work and how do you anticipate they might help\nyou moving forward yeah I can take that question um so we have made quite a bit of\nadvances in our machine learning models to kind of tie together our complex radiation hydrodynamic simulations with\nthe experimental data and learning um specifically going between the August 8th 2021 experiment and this this latest\nexperiment we used it more for the predictability phase versus the design\nphase for the for this change so for this change we sort of used our traditional design methods of you know\nnot running thousands of simulations but then we fed the the design to the team\nthat the cogsim machine learning team and had them have them do an analysis of\nthe design and they did find that it had a higher probability of achieving gain at one\nso uh with with the cogson models we're able to look at uh more if the design is\nmore robust to some of the issues that we had been having last year thanks Annie now I believe we have time\nfor one or two more questions so before we go back to Nat Geo uh David Crandall retired from\nDepartment of energy where I spent 30 years in most of it related to Fusion\nand most of it related to nif the target\nthe target for 080821 the physics ignition shot was deemed to be the most\npure Target you ever shot how did this one compare um yes as you mentioned the target for\n210808 was probably the most pristine shell that we've ever had it even compared favorably to the other shells\nin the batches we learned later on as we reanalyzed the data for all those shells this target here had a substantial\nnumber of flaws compared to that one specifically at higher it has tungsten inclusions in a large number\nall right time for our final question\nuh James Reardon Science News Magazine um so this experiment um\nis specifically interested in in the in the search for ignition but most of your\nresearch at is is focused on stockpile stewardship is it is it not and in that\ncase what fraction is dedicated to this sort of research what fraction is dedicated to stockpile stewardship and\ndo these sorts of shots have any important information in them for stockpile stewardship\nsure I'm happy to take that one so the ignition work we're doing is for\nstockpile stewardship right our thermonuclear weapons have Fusion ignition uh that takes place in our\nweapons and so studying Fusion ignition is something we do to support the stockpile stewardship program in\naddition Fusion ignition creates these very extreme environments that we have no other way to access on Earth and in\nfact in this experiment for the first time ever we were able to put some samples of materials that are\nimportant for our future stockpile modernization efforts that are going on at Lawrence of Moore today in very close\nto this intense Neutron burst and then see how did they respond to that intense new tremper so we're actually using the\noutput from these really cool science experiments uh and which we're also\ntrying to understand we're also using it to actually test materials for stewardship applications but to your\nother question roughly speaking about 15 percent of the experiments we do on nif are indirect\nDrive experiments of the type that this experiment was we do another roughly 15\npercent that are other types of fusion experiments inertial confinement Fusion but using different approaches and then\nthe rest of them look at things like the behavior of materials and high pressures and getting data that's important to use\nin our simulations for our nuclear weapons understanding the behavior of radiation and very complex environments\nand geometries understanding how hydrodynamic plasmas mix at very high\ntemperatures all of those things help us Benchmark our simulation tools learn new\nthings about how matter behaves in these really extreme conditions and underpins the confidence we have in in our\ndeterrent thank you and we had a question\nwell thank you um how many questions do I get to ask as many as you want well this is this is\nreally exciting my understanding was that the experiment in 2021 was a little unexpected result\nwhich was really good news and then it was kind of hard to repeat that result so was it more the Target and something\nthat Annie brought up that I hadn't been aware of is the the time history of the of the laser pulses is also important so\nuh first question is what's what's more dominant the the time history or the\ntarget uh and a question for Arthur how many orders of magnitude of neutron\nflux do you have to monitor to get a full picture so I can answer the last question first\nperhaps so you know as Alex pointed out you know many things have to happen\num have to go right basically for for these experiments to really reach very very high yields and gains so we have to\nset up our Diagnostics to capture that a bit but we also have to set up the Diagnostics to capture lower orders of\nmagnitude so that if it doesn't go right we understand what happened what was the failure mechanism so we can fix it in\nthe future and so you know right now I think we have something like three orders or so of dynamic range that we\ncan measure so we so we have predictions of how we set up the Diagnostics we try to go above and below to make sure we we\nget good measurements does that answer your question yeah yeah so I can take a crack at the other\none um so I'm going into 210808 or August 8th of 2021 experiment we predicted\nabout half the yield increase that we got we got about eight times the yield increase and we predicted about four\ntimes and the reason for that is because we had improved the capsule quality like\nwas mentioned earlier so going into the pre-shot prediction we're assuming the\nsame capsule quality with some other design changes that were being made we\ndid perform a set of experiments after that to try to piece apart which is quality and which is the other design\nchanges and it was pretty consistent with that sort of split between the two\nfollowing that experiment we haven't been able to replicate the same capsule quality and that is a main driver\nbecause these defects are extremely difficult to model and predict it's been\na main driver in the performance as well as the predictability so then the thought was to try to design our way\naround some of these stringent requirements and what was the other part of your\nquestion the time history yeah thanks yeah thank you um so the time history there's different\nforms of asymmetries and the one that I'm talking about the change that was\nmade between September and this most recent experiment was a slightly different type of that's an intrinsic\nsymmetry correction during the repeat experiments we did have two experiments\nthat had an anomalous laser deviation which is is a mode one so that means for\nexample if the laser delivered differently on top versus bottom that would push the implosion in One\nDirection so something that's not designed or expected that did impact two of those experiments but ever since then\nwe've been quite good and maybe JM can talk about the improvements made there that that hasn't been as big of an issue\nyeah I can elaborate if you like we basically are\num in the process of modernizing the the what we call the front end of the laser\nwhich is based on the fiber optics technology um the nif laser was first commissioned\nat low level in 2001 so this part of the laser was literally 20 year old and as\nyou can imagine in Telecom industry over 20 years there has been many revolutions and so we were able to catch up and\ncapitalize on the latest Technologies to improve this delivery\nall right time for our final question I think\nwe're here um James Osborne Houston Chronicle again um I think you've probably answered this but maybe just for the Layman about I'm\namongst um so if the shell quality wasn't as\nclean on this experiment What What In fact made the difference were you were able to achieve this breakthrough this\ntime what what what do you what do you attribute it to yeah so um the the speed\nshot basically the same capsule quality in September so that part remained constant between the two experiments and\nin September we achieved about 1.22 megajoules\num so being able to First achieve megajoule yields again with worse\ncapsule quality than August 8th 2021 that was the first step and that was\nattributed to the the laser enhanced laser capability and the design change of the thicker Target\nand then moving between September and the most recent experiment the only changes to the input conditions were to\nimprove this intrinsic low mode asymmetry so make the implosion more symmetric as it's coming in you can\nbetter couple your driver energy to the Hot D the hot plasma\nall right I'd like to thank everyone for coming and I'd like to thank Dr Herman in the panel for taking time to share\nthis amazing achievable buzz after what must be a whirlwind week one more round of applause please\nand with that that concludes our nif press conference event thank you for coming"}]}

Given that they are looking for a candidate that can lead a community of practice, so it would be beneficial to mention any experience you have in leading teams, mentoring, on-boarding and training new users, and enforcing policies.In terms of education, it is mentioned that a Bachelor's degree is required and 3+ years of relevant hands-on experience in CDP/CRM solutions, Marketing Automation, and/or other MarTech technologies.Consider using action verbs such as designed, built, maintained, lead, trained, enforced, articulated, translated, consulted and coordinated while listing your experience.In summary, to tailor your resume for this position, you should focus on highlighting your experience with Redpoint and campaign building, your experience leading cross-functional teams, your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and any experience you have with CDP/CRM solutions and marketing automation.I don't have experience with Javascript or CSS.

Instead of specifically mentioning these skills, I've highlighted your experience with data management, collaboration with cross-functional teams, and leading a community of practice. I also have added in emphasis on your professional experience and education that relate to the role, this will show the employer that you have the necessary experience to fulfill the requirements of the job, even if you don't have experience with all of the specific technical skills listed in the job posting.Change the education section to be more accurate. I graduated from University of Minnesota with a Bachelor's of Science degree in marketing education. This degree is accurate and still relevant to the position. Sure, here's the updated Education section for your resume:EDUCATION\nBachelor of Science in Marketing Education, University of MinnesotaThis updated education section is more accurate and will reflect that you graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Science in Marketing Education, which could be relevant to the role you are applying to, as it relates to marketing and also it would align with the requirements of the job posting.You are now a HR professional at the client for this recruiter. You recieve the resume version with the updates discussed. What concerns do you have about the candidate? As an HR professional screening for the position in the job description would the salesforce experience be considered valuable? As an HR professional reviewing this updated version of the candidate's resume, there are a few potential concerns I might have:Although the candidate has experience with Redpoint, it's not clear from the resume how much hands-on experience they have with the platform. It's important to ensure that the candidate has the required level of expertise in Redpoint to be successful in the role.Similarly, the candidate has mentioned that their experience with HTML is novice, which could be a concern for a position that requires some level of knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as listed in the job posting.The candidate's education in Marketing Education, while relevant, does not specifically mention any technical skills that are required for the position like CDP/CRM solutions and Marketing Automation. However, I would need to check whether their professional experience covers those areas in the job posting.In terms of the candidate's Salesforce experience, it is not directly related to the Redpoint role, but it is possible that the experience of working with Salesforce, and experience with data management and agile development process, can bring value to the organization, especially if they are using Salesforce platform and it may be a benefit to have someone who is familiar with it. However, it ultimately depends on how important Salesforce experience is to the role and the organization. The most important aspect would be the candidate’s proficiency and hands-on experience with Redpoint as that is the primary requirement of the role.I, the candidate, worked in the redpoint platform 3 to 5 hrs per day for 4 years. I am familliar with many foundational principles of the tool. I maintained over 100 stored procedures and Journies that sent over 100,000 emails and 100,000 letters per month.

It does not provide any information about the size of the community you led, how many users you onboarded or trained, or the outcome of your efforts. Also, this may not be directly related to the key requirements of the role that is advertised and therefore might be less valuable in terms of showing your qualifications and experience.\nIt would be more effective if the bullet point had more specific examples and details that give the reader a clearer understanding of your experience and how it will translate to this role.remove the least valuable bullet.

Today, we'll be exploring their different perspectives on the age-old question: What is the meaning of life?Aristotle: For me, the meaning of life is to achieve happiness through living a life of virtue and contemplation. This means striving to become the best version of ourselves, and using our reason to understand the world and our place in it.Immanuel Kant: I disagree. I believe that the meaning of life is to strive for the highest good, which is the good will. This means acting out of a sense of duty, rather than for personal pleasure or gain.John Rawls: I propose a different perspective. The meaning of life, for me, is to achieve a just society in which all individuals have an equal opportunity to pursue their own conception of the good life. This means working towards a society in which everyone has access to the basic necessities of life, and the freedom to choose their own path.Narrator: So, according to Aristotle, the meaning of life is to achieve happiness through virtue and contemplation. For Kant, it's to strive for the highest good of the good will. And for Rawls, it's to create a just society where everyone has the opportunity to pursue their own conception of the good life.Thank you for joining us for this thought-provoking discussion on the meaning of life. We hope you've gained a new perspective on this timeless question.rewrite this script but without the narrator and with more back-and-forth debate and argument. Make it between 1500 and 3000 words. make it similar to a public forum debate. Aristotle: Good evening, everyone. I'm Aristotle, and I believe that the meaning of life is to achieve happiness through living a life of virtue and contemplation. This means striving to become the best version of ourselves, and using our reason to understand the world and our place in it.Immanuel Kant: I disagree, Aristotle. I'm Immanuel Kant, and I believe that the meaning of life is to strive for the highest good, which is the good will. This means acting out of a sense of duty, rather than for personal pleasure or gain.John Rawls: Hello, I'm John Rawls. I propose a different perspective. The meaning of life, for me, is to achieve a just society in which all individuals have an equal opportunity to pursue their own conception of the good life. This means working towards a society in which everyone has access to the basic necessities of life, and the freedom to choose their own path.Aristotle: Kant, your perspective on the meaning of life seems to prioritize moral duty over personal happiness. But I would argue that a life of virtue and contemplation, as I propose, is ultimately the most fulfilling and fulfilling way to live.Immanuel Kant: I see your point, Aristotle, but I believe that true happiness comes from living a moral life and fulfilling our duties. Personal pleasure and happiness are fleeting and unreliable, while the good will is eternal and fulfilling.John Rawls: I agree with both of you to an extent, but I believe that the most fulfilling life is one in which everyone has the opportunity to pursue their own conception of the good life. A just society, in which everyone has access to basic necessities and freedom of choice, allows for the greatest flourishing of individuals.Aristotle: I can see the value in creating a just society, Rawls, but I would argue that individual flourishing is ultimately tied to living a life of virtue and contemplation. Without this foundation, a just society may not lead to true happiness.Immanuel Kant: I agree with Aristotle on this point. A just society is important, but without a focus on moral duty and the good will, it may not lead to true happiness and fulfillment.John Rawls: I understand your perspective, but I believe that a just society is the foundation upon which individuals can pursue their own conceptions of the good life. Without this foundation, it may be difficult for individuals to find happiness and fulfillment.Aristotle: I think we all agree that a just society is important, but I would argue that personal virtue and contemplation are ultimately the key to happiness and fulfillment.Immanuel Kant: I agree, Aristotle. Living a life of moral duty and the good will is essential to finding true happiness.John Rawls: I understand your perspective, but I believe that a just society, in which individuals have the opportunity to pursue their own conceptions of the good life, is also essential to happiness and fulfillment.Aristotle: I see your point, Rawls, and I agree that a just society is important. But I would argue that personal virtue and contemplation are the foundation upon which a just society can be built.Immanuel Kant: I agree with Aristotle. Personal virtue and the good will are the foundation for a just and fulfilling society.John Rawls: I understand your perspective, and I agree that personal virtue and the good will are important. However, I believe that a just society is also necessary for individuals to fully realize their potential and find happiness and fulfillment.Aristotle: I think we can all agree that both personal virtue and a just society are important for happiness and fulfillment.Immanuel Kant: Irewrite the scripts above but have our characters speak more naturally and passionately. Also keep in mind this is for a viral youtube video. And make the script about 5 minutes longAristotle: Hi, everyone. I'm Aristotle, and I'm here to talk about the meaning of life. For me, it's all about achieving happiness through living a virtuous and contemplative life. That means striving to be the best version of ourselves and using our reason to understand the world and our place in it.Immanuel Kant: Hey, I'm Immanuel Kant, and I disagree. For me, the meaning of life is about striving for the highest good, which is the good will. That means acting out of a sense of duty and morality, rather than just seeking personal pleasure or gain.John Rawls: Hi, I'm John Rawls. I think we need to consider the role of society in all of this. For me, the meaning of life is about creating a just society where everyone has the opportunity to pursue their own conception of the good life. That means everyone should have access to basic necessities and the freedom to make their own choices.Aristotle: Kant, I understand where you're coming from, but I believe that a life of virtue and contemplation is the key to true happiness. Without that foundation, we can't fully flourish as individuals.Immanuel Kant: I see your point, Aristotle, but I think true happiness comes from living a moral life and fulfilling our duties. Pleasure and happiness are fleeting, but the good will is eternal and fulfilling.John Rawls: I agree with both of you, but I also think that a just society is necessary for individuals to reach their full potential and find happiness. Without that foundation, it can be hard for people to find fulfillment.Aristotle: I see your point, Rawls, but I still believe that personal virtue is the foundation upon which a just society can be built.Immanuel Kant: I agree with Aristotle. Personal virtue and the good will are the cornerstone of a just and fulfilling society.John Rawls: I understand where you're coming from, but I think we also need to consider the systemic barriers that prevent some people from pursuing their own conceptions of the good life. A just society addresses those barriers and gives everyone an equal opportunity to flourish.Aristotle: I agree that a just society is important, but I still believe that personal virtue is the key to happiness and fulfillment.Immanuel Kant: I agree with Aristotle. Without personal virtue and a focus on the good will, a just society may not lead to true happiness and fulfillment.John Rawls: I understand your perspective, but I think a just society is also necessary for individuals to fully realize their potential and find happiness. Without that foundation, it can be difficult for people to achieve fulfillment.Aristotle: I think we can all agree that both personal virtue and a just society are important for happiness and fulfillment. It's about finding the right balance between the two.Immanuel Kant: I agree. It's about finding a balance between personal virtue, the good will, and creating a just society.John Rawls: I agree. It's about finding a balance between personal virtue, the good will, and creating a just society that gives everyone an equal opportunity to pursue their own conception of the good life.Thanks for joining us for this discussion on the meaning of life. We hope you've gained a new perspective on this timeless question.rewrite this script, but replace John Rawls with both John Locke and NietzcheAristotle: Hi, everyone.

I think we also need to consider the role of individual rights and freedoms in all of this. For me, the meaning of life is about living in a society that respects and protects our natural rights.Nietzsche: Hello, I'm Nietzsche. I disagree with both of you. The meaning of life is not about achieving happiness or fulfilling moral duties. It's about creating our own values and creating our own meaning in a meaningless world.Aristotle: Locke, I understand your perspective, but I believe that a life of virtue and contemplation is the key to true happiness.

Personal virtue and the good will are the cornerstone of a just and fulfilling society.John Locke: I agree with Aristotle and Kant. Personal virtue and the good will are important, but they must be balanced with individual rights and freedoms in order for people to fully flourish.Nietzsche: I disagree with all of you.

We should reject these concepts and create our own values.Aristotle: I think we can all agree that personal virtue and a just society are important for happiness and fulfillment.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why have nothing to override, but still can put @Override without syntax error?\nI am using Java language level 17 on JDK 19.The @Override annotation is used to indicate that a method in a subclass is intended to override a method with the same signature in its superclass. While it is not required to use the @Override annotation, it is considered a best practice to do so because it can help catch errors early on.If you put the @Override annotation on a method that does not actually override a method in the superclass, the Java compiler will generate a compile-time error. This is useful because it can help you catch errors early on, before you run the code. For example, if you accidentally misspell the name of a method or change its signature, the compiler will generate an error and alert you to the problem.It's worth noting that the @Override annotation only applicable to methods, a class cannot be marked with this annotation.Also, you're mentioning you're using Java 17 and JDK 19, but Java 17 is not a version that exists and JDK 19 is the latest version as of my knowledge cutoff, which means you might have some other issues or mistaken the version you are using.Why have nothing to override, but still can put @Override without syntax error?\n\nI am using Java language level 17 on JDK 19. I have\n\npackage ocp17.ch07;\n\npublic record BeardedDragon(boolean fun) {\n    \n    @Override\n    public boolean fun() {\n        return false;\n    }\n    \n}In your example, you have a class BeardedDragon that has a fun() method which is using @Override annotation but there is no corresponding method from any parent class that it overrides.This is because in Java 14, the feature of Records was introduced, records are new kind of classes, they are like a data class, and unlike other classes, records can't have explicit instance fields, constructors, methods, or initializer blocks. Instead, they automatically get various members based on their components. And one of them is a public accessor method that matches the name of each component and return the value of that component.In your case, fun is the component name of the record BeardedDragon so when you define a method with the same name as the component and use @Override, you are not actually overriding a method from a parent class, but you are providing the implementation for the automatically generated accessor method for the fun component.It's worth mentioning that, the @Override annotation is not necessary in this case, but it's a good practice if you are intending to implement the record accessor method, it will let your development team know that the method is being overridden and also it will help to prevent errors if the component's name or signature was to change in future.The application which I am working on is debugging fine in emulator or in mobiles but when I try to build the apk it gives the following Error:\n\nBuilding without sound null safety\nFor more information see https://dart.dev/null-safety/unsound-null-safety\n\nRunning Gradle task 'assembleRelease'...                        \n\n\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\n\n* What went wrong:\nExecution failed for task ':app:lintVitalRelease'.\n&gt; Could not resolve all artifacts for configuration ':image_picker_android:debugUnitTestRuntimeClasspath'.\n   &gt; Failed to transform bcprov-jdk15on-1.68.jar (org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.68) to match attributes {artifactType=processed-jar, org.gradle.category=library, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, org.gradle.status=release, org.gradle.usage=java-runtime}.\n      &gt; Execution failed for JetifyTransform: /home/cicada/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk15on/1.68/46a080368d38b428d237a59458f9bc915222894d/bcprov-jdk15on-1.68.jar.\n         &gt; Failed to transform '/home/cicada/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk15on/1.68/46a080368d38b428d237a59458f9bc915222894d/bcprov-jdk15on-1.68.jar' using Jetifier.

This task is used by the Android Gradle plugin to check for potential issues in the code and ensure that it meets certain coding standards.The specific error that's causing the failure is related to a library called bcprov-jdk15on version 1.68, which is failing to be transformed by the Jetifier. Jetifier is a tool that automatically converts libraries and dependencies that use the Android Support Library to use the Android X Library, which is now the recommended library for Android development.The error message states that the Jetifier is failing because it's encountering an \"Unsupported class file major version 59.\" This indicates that the library being transformed is using a version of the Java class file format that's not supported by Jetifier. The class file format version 59 corresponds to Java 15, which is newer than the version of Java that the Jetifier is built against.One solution is to check the documentation of the project you're working on and see if there's any reference to the library that is causing the issue, If it is not necessary for the project you can remove it, if it's essential for the project you can try to update to a newer version of the library.Another option is to try disabling the Jetifier for this specific library by adding the following line to the android block in the app/build.gradle file:Copy codeandroid {\n    ...\n    packagingOptions {\n        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE.txt'\n        exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE.txt'\n        exclude 'META-INF/BCKEY.DSA'\n        exclude 'META-INF/BCKEY.SF'\n    }\n    ...\n}\nPlease note that this will disable the Jetifier for all libraries and dependencies in your project, and this might cause other issues down the line.If none of these solutions work for you, you can also try to update the gradle version of your project, if the gradle is behind the latest version, it may cause the compatibility issues.Flutter Error : Could not resolve all artifacts for configuration ':image_picker_android:debugUnitTestRuntimeClasspath'\n\nThe application which I am working on is debugging fine in emulator or in mobiles but when I try to build the apk it gives the following Error:\n\nBuilding without sound null safety\nFor more information see https://dart.dev/null-safety/unsound-null-safety\n\nRunning Gradle task 'assembleRelease'...                        \n\n\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\n\n* What went wrong:\nExecution failed for task ':app:lintVitalRelease'.\n&gt; Could not resolve all artifacts for configuration ':image_picker_android:debugUnitTestRuntimeClasspath'.\n   &gt; Failed to transform bcprov-jdk15on-1.68.jar (org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.68) to match attributes {artifactType=processed-jar, org.gradle.category=library, org.gradle.libraryelements=jar, org.gradle.status=release, org.gradle.usage=java-runtime}.\n      &gt; Execution failed for JetifyTransform: /home/cicada/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk15on/1.68/46a080368d38b428d237a59458f9bc915222894d/bcprov-jdk15on-1.68.jar.\n         &gt; Failed to transform '/home/cicada/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-jdk15on/1.68/46a080368d38b428d237a59458f9bc915222894d/bcprov-jdk15on-1.68.jar' using Jetifier.

The class file format version 59 corresponds to Java 15, which is newer than the version of Java that the Jetifier is built against.One solution is to check the documentation of the package image_picker_android you're using and see if there's any reference to the library that is causing the issue, If it is not necessary for the package you can remove it, if it's essential for the package you can try to update to a newer version of the library.Another option is to try disabling the Jetifier for this specific library by adding the following line to the android block in the app/build.gradle file:Copy codeandroid {\n    ...\n    packagingOptions {\n        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE.txt'\n        exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE.txt'\n        exclude 'META-INF/BCKEY.DSA'\n        exclude 'META-INF/BCKEY.SF'\n    }\n    ...\n}\nPlease note that this will disable the Jetifier for all libraries and dependencies in your project, and this might cause other issues down the line.Another way to solve this issue is, you can try to update the image_picker_android package to its latest version, if there is any bugfix or compatibility issue with the latest version of gradle.It's also worth checking if your flutter version is up-to-date and also check your android studio and gradle version for compatibility with your flutter version.GitHub Actions: Required property is missing: shell\n\n\nIntroduction\nI am currently to crate a composite GitHub Actions that build a JavaDoc from Java project and publish it automatically to a static page with GitHub Page.\n\nProblematic\nBut I got this error when I try to run it:\n\nCurrent runner version: '2.287.1' Operating System Virtual Environment Virtual Environment Provisioner GITHUB_TOKEN Permissions Secret source: Actions Prepare workflow directory Prepare all required actions Getting action download info Download action repository 'MathieuSoysal/Javadoc-publisher.yml@v2.0.2' (SHA:878c07f835dd9bcbb8800090d109c91b0f0d4581) Error: MathieuSoysal/Javadoc-publisher.yml/v2.0.2/action.yml (Line: 29, Col: 5): Required property is missing: shell Error: MathieuSoysal/Javadoc-publisher.yml/v2.0.2/action.yml (Line: 29, Col: 5): Required property is missing: shell Error: GitHub.DistributedTask.ObjectTemplating.TemplateValidationException: The template is not valid.

Please check that you are connecting to an Elasticsearch instance, and that any networking filters are preserving that header.\nI've tried manually putting this header via the setDefaultHeaders method like this:\n\nRestClientBuilder builder = RestClient.builder(\n new HttpHost(\"localhost\", 9200, \"http\"));\nHeader[] defaultHeaders = new Header[]{new BasicHeader(\"X-Elastic-Product\", \"Elasticsearch\")};\nbuilder.setDefaultHeaders(defaultHeaders);\nRestClient restClient = builder.build();\nBut the error is the same.\n\nI've tried both version 7.16 and 8.0.0, same result.The error message \"Missing [X-Elastic-Product] header\" suggests that the Elasticsearch client is expecting an \"X-Elastic-Product\" header to be present in the requests it's making, but it's not finding it.The \"X-Elastic-Product\" header is added by the Elasticsearch server by default, but it may not be present if you're running Elasticsearch behind a reverse proxy or some other networking component that's not preserving this header.There are a couple of things you can try to fix this issue:Check if the Elasticsearch server is running and is accessible at the host and port specified in the client code (\"localhost\", 9200). If the server is not running, or if there's a network issue preventing the client from connecting to it, the \"X-Elastic-Product\" header will not be present.If you are running elasticsearch behind a proxy, you can try to add the header in the proxy with this format \"X-Elastic-Product: Elasticsearch\" that the client expectedCheck if any networking filters or firewalls in place that could be blocking or modifying the headers of the requests being made by the client.If the above methods don't work, you can try to use an older version of the Elasticsearch client library that doesn't require the \"X-Elastic-Product\" header.Another solution you can try is, to try to use a different Java Elasticsearch client library, like Elasticsearch Java High-level REST Client, which is the recommended client for Elasticsearch 7.x and later.It's worth checking the official documentation of the library to see if there are any known issues and their solutions.Why doesn't instanceof pattern matching work with else if in this particular case?\n\nThe following snippet does not compile on javac, version 17 (Temurin)\n\nclass Instanceof {\n    static void doesNotWork(Object o) {\n        if (o == null) {\n            throw new Error();\n        } else if (!(o instanceof String s)) {\n            throw new Error();\n        }   \n        System.out.println(s); // error here\n    }\n}\nIt generates this error: cannot find symbol\n\ncannot find symbol\nsymbol:   variable s\nlocation: class Instanceof\nHowever, the following (in my opinion) equivalent variations work: With an explicit else block:\n\nstatic void doesWork(Object o) {\n    if (o == null) {\n        throw new Error();\n    } else if (!(o instanceof String s)) {\n        throw new Error();\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(s);\n    }\n}\nOr without an else:\n\nstatic void doesWork(Object o) {\n    if (o == null) {\n        throw new Error();\n    }\n    if (!(o instanceof String s)) {\n        throw new Error();\n    }\n    System.out.println(s);\n}\nOr with a single if:\n\nstatic void doesWork(Object o) {\n    if (o == null || !(o instanceof String s)) {\n        throw new Error();\n    }\n    System.out.println(s);\n}\nIs this a bug in javac? If yes, should I report this, but where exactly?The reason why the code in the \"doesNotWork\" method doesn't work is because of the way instanceof pattern matching works in combination with else if.In the \"doesNotWork\" method, the first \"if\" statement checks if the input \"o\" is null and throws an error if it is. The second \"else if\" statement then checks if \"o\" is not an instance of String and throws an error if it isn't. However, because of the way instanceof pattern matching works, the variable \"s\" is only in scope within the \"else if\" block and not in the following code block.That's why the following two variants \"doesWork\" function works, in the first, you are providing an else block where you are printing the value of the variable 's' so that it is in scope, and in the second, you are moving the print statement right after the declaration of the variable 's' so that it is in the same scope.It is not a bug, it is the expected behavior of the instanceof pattern matching feature, you can consider this limitation of the feature. It is worth noting that, this has been fixed in later versions of Java, This would have been working fine with Java 14 or later.Eclipse: Project 'PROJECT_NAME' has no explicit encoding set\n\nI downgraded from Windows 11 to Windows 10 today and had to reinstall the Eclipse-IDE.\nAfter successfully importing my workspaces and fixing the projects, a warning appeared for every project saying \"Project XXX has no explicit encoding set\". I've already searched for a solution and only got some fixes for VSCode.\n\nI had Eclipse 2021-6 and installed Eclipse 2022-6The warning \"Project XXX has no explicit encoding set\" in Eclipse indicates that the project's file encoding is not explicitly set in the project's properties.By default, Eclipse uses the system's default encoding to save and load files. However, this may cause problems if the system's default encoding is different than the one used in the project's source files.To fix this warning, you can set the file encoding for the project to match the encoding used in the source files.Here are the steps to set the file encoding for a project in Eclipse:Right-click on the project in the Package Explorer or Project Explorer and select Properties.In the Properties dialog, select the Resource category.In the Text file encoding section, select the desired encoding from the drop-down list or click Other to select a different encoding.Click OK to apply the changes and close the Properties dialog.This should resolve the warning and ensure that the project's files are saved and loaded with the correct encoding.It is worth mentioning that, this error message is shown in the projects which were imported from older versions of eclipse and not set the encoding, but you don't need to worry about that, you can just set the encoding of the projects as I explained and the error should be gone.Error while importing Springboot 2.7 projects in intellij Idea with maven 3.8.5\n\nwhen Using start.spring.io projects generated with springboot 2.7 comes with MavenProject 3.8.5 which when imported in intellij causes an error that is quite difficult to debug or not self speaking by itself.\n\nThe error\n\njava.lang.RuntimeException: org.codehaus.plexus.component.repository.exception.ComponentLookupException: com.google.inject.ProvisionException: Unable to provision, see the following errors:\n\n1) Error injecting constructor, java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.maven.model.validation.DefaultModelValidator: method 'void ()' not found\n  at org.jetbrains.idea.maven.server.embedder.CustomModelValidator.(Unknown Source)\n  while locating org.jetbrains.idea.maven.server.embedder.CustomModelValidator\n  at ClassRealm[maven.ext, parent: ClassRealm[plexus.core, parent: null]] (via modules: org.eclipse.sisu.wire.WireModule -&gt; org.eclipse.sisu.plexus.PlexusBindingModule)\n  while locating org.apache.maven.model.validation.ModelValidator annotated with @com.google.inject.name.Named(value=\"ide\")\n\n1 error\n      role: org.apache.maven.model.validation.ModelValidator\n  roleHint: ideThis error message is indicating that there is a problem with the version of the Maven Project component that you are using. Specifically, it is having trouble finding a constructor for the DefaultModelValidator class that takes no arguments, and instead only finding one that does take arguments.This is likely caused by a conflict between the version of the Maven Project component that IntelliJ IDEA is using (which is bundled with the IDE) and the version that the Spring Boot project is using. IntelliJ IDEA is expecting a different version of the component, and the error occurs because it can't find the expected constructor.To solve this issue, you can try updating the version of the Maven Project component that is being used by the Spring Boot project to match the version that IntelliJ IDEA is using. You can do this by updating the maven-model-builder dependency in the project's pom.xml file to match the version that IntelliJ IDEA is using.Another solution would be to install the latest version of intellij idea and select the option of \"Import project from external model\" then select maven, This will automatically import the project with the correct version of maven and resolve the error.You can also try disabling the Maven integration for the Spring Boot project in IntelliJ IDEA and instead use the command-line Maven tool to build and manage the project.I ran into this scenario in the process of developing a lightweight library for asynchronous messaging. Trying to get an idea of the cost of creating lots of medium sized objects with short lifetimes, I wrote the following test:\n\nimport java.nio.ByteBuffer;\nimport java.util.Random;\n\n\npublic class MemPressureTest {\n    static final int SIZE = 4096;\n    static final class Bigish {\n        final ByteBuffer b;\n\n\n        public Bigish() {\n            this(ByteBuffer.allocate(SIZE));\n        }\n\n        public Bigish(ByteBuffer b) {\n            this.b = b;\n        }\n\n        public void fill(byte bt) {\n            b.clear();\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; SIZE; ++i) {\n                b.put(bt);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Random random = new Random(1);\n        Bigish tmp = new Bigish();\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3e7; ++i) {\n            tmp.fill((byte)random.nextInt(255));\n        }\n    }\n}\nOn my laptop, with default GC settings, it runs in about 95 seconds:\n\n/tmp$ time java -Xlog:gc MemPressureTest\n[0.006s][info][gc] Using G1\n\nreal    1m35.552s\nuser    1m33.658s\nsys 0m0.428s\nThis is where things get strange. I tweaked the program to allocate a new object for each iteration:\n\n...\n        Random random = new Random(1);\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3e7; ++i) {\n            Bigish tmp = new Bigish();\n            tmp.fill((byte)random.nextInt(255));\n        }\n...\nIn theory, this should add some small overhead, but none of the objects should ever be promoted out of Eden. At best, I'd expect the runtimes to be close to identical. However, this test completes in ~17 seconds:\n\n/tmp$ time java -Xlog:gc MemPressureTest\n[0.007s][info][gc] Using G1\n[0.090s][info][gc] GC(0) Pause Young (Normal) (G1 Evacuation Pause) 23M-&gt;1M(130M) 1.304ms\n[0.181s][info][gc] GC(1) Pause Young (Normal) (G1 Evacuation Pause) 76M-&gt;1M(130M) 0.870ms\n[0.247s][info][gc] GC(2) Pause Young (Normal) (G1 Evacuation Pause) 76M-&gt;0M(130M) 0.844ms\n[0.317s][info][gc] GC(3) Pause Young (Normal) (G1 Evacuation Pause) 75M-&gt;0M(130M) 0.793ms\n[0.381s][info][gc] GC(4) Pause Young (Normal) (G1 Evacuation Pause) 75M-&gt;0M(130M) 0.859ms\n[lots of similar GC pauses, snipped for brevity]\n[16.608s][info][gc] GC(482) Pause Young (Normal) (G1 Evacuation Pause) 254M-&gt;0M(425M) 0.765ms\n[16.643s][info][gc] GC(483) Pause Young (Normal) (G1 Evacuation Pause) 254M-&gt;0M(425M) 0.580ms\n[16.676s][info][gc] GC(484) Pause Young (Normal) (G1 Evacuation Pause) 254M-&gt;0M(425M) 0.841ms\n\nreal    0m16.766s\nuser    0m16.578s\nsys 0m0.576s\nI ran both versions several times, with near identical results to the above. I feel like I must be missing something very obvious. Am I going insane? What could explain this difference in performance?The difference in performance you are seeing is likely due to the way that the Garbage Collector (GC) is handling the objects in the two different versions of the program.In the first version of the program, the Bigish object is instantiated only once, and then the fill() method is repeatedly called on the same object. This means that the GC needs to track only one object in the heap, and it needs to decide when to clean it up. However, because the object is continuously being updated, it is likely that the GC is not able to clean it up. This causes the heap to grow, which may result in full GCs, which can cause the program to run slowly.In the second version of the program, a new Bigish object is instantiated on each iteration of the loop. The objects are used for a very short period of time, and therefore the GC can quickly clean them up. This means that the heap does not grow, and the program runs much faster.This behavior is likely caused by G1 GC, which is a garbage collector that aims to minimize the impact of garbage collection on the application. Instead of doing a full GC on the entire heap, it splits the heap into small regions and only collects the regions that contain the most garbage. When the heap is large, this can cause full GCs. But in the second version of your program, the heap is small, and it can quickly clean up the objects and not affect the performance so much.It is not a mistake, but it's normal to have such a difference in performance based on the way you are allocating the objects, and how they are used.Stream.peek() can be skipped for optimization\n\n've come across a rule in Sonar which says:\n\nA key difference with other intermediate Stream operations is that the Stream implementation is free to skip calls to peek() for optimization purpose. This can lead to peek() being unexpectedly called only for some or none of the elements in the Stream.\n\nAlso, it's mentioned in the Javadoc which says:\n\nThis method exists mainly to support debugging, where you want to see the elements as they flow past a certain point in a pipeline\n\nIn which case can java.util.Stream.peek() be skipped? Is it related to debugging?The Stream.peek() method is an intermediate operation that is used to \"peek\" at the elements of a stream before they are processed by the next operation. The method takes a Consumer function as an argument, which is used to perform some action on each element of the stream as it is processed.In terms of optimization, the peek() method is considered a \"non-terminal\" operation, meaning that it does not cause the stream to be evaluated or consumed. It is therefore free for the implementation to skip calls to peek() for optimization purposes. This can happen when the implementation determines that the results of the peek() operation are not needed for the subsequent terminal operation, or when the implementation can optimize the stream processing in a way that makes the peek() operation redundant.The Javadoc states that the main purpose of peek() method is to support debugging. Indeed, when you want to see the elements as they flow past a certain point in a pipeline, peek() is very useful.It is not necessarily related to debugging only, it can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as for debugging, logging, auditing, or for maintaining some form of state or context during the processing of a stream. However, as it is not guaranteed that peek() will be called for every element, it may not be suitable for these scenarios.Firebase Tools and Java 11\n\n\nThis question falls somewhere between Firebase Tools, MacOS and Java. Probably 75% Java, 20% Firebase Tools and 5% MacOS.\n\nStarting with v10.5, firebase-tools started stating that 'Support for Java version &lt;= 10 will be dropped soon in firebase-tools@11. Please upgrade to Java version 11 or above to continue using the emulators.'\n\nI run macOS v11.6.5 on a Macbook Pro from mid-2014. When I go to Java's Downloads page, it recommends Java 'Version 8 Update 331'. Not Java 11.\n\nInformation on downloading Java 11 seems to be scarce. Oracle's page of certified configurations includes MacOS 11, but I can't find anywhere obvious where Java 11 can be readily downloaded.\n\nA big part of the problem seems to be the terminology used. If I run java -version, I get:\n\njava version \"1.8.0_331\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_331-b09)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.331-b09, mixed mode)\nOkay, I have build 1.8 of the Java Runtime Environment, aka the JRE if you are a Java enthusiast. That is apparently what is triggering the warning in Firebase Tools.\n\nThere is also a Java product out there called 'Java SE 11'. The product itself is ambiguous, but the checksums all say 'SDK'. (A Software Development Kit: a thing that enables developers to develop Java programs. The name doesn't imply a Runtime Environment: a thing that enables Java to run on an operating system.) There is an article out there which claims that, if you install Java SE 11 and run java -version, it will spit out java version \"11.0.7\". That will probably satisfy Firebase Tools.\n\nBut Oracle's release notes say: 'In Windows and macOS, installing the JDK in previous releases optionally installed a JRE. In JDK 11, this is no longer an option.' No longer an option... as in now you implicitly get JRE 11 with SDK 11? Or as in the SDK and JRE are now fully divorced, and the JRE must be ferreted out of its hiding like a wild beast?\n\nUPDATE 6/5/22: Java's checksums page now says 'JDK', and I guess that is better than 'SDK' because it implies 'Java Development Kit', which this Wikipedia article claims to include both a JRE ('java') and SDK (most of the other files).Starting with Firebase Tools version 10.5, support for Java version 10 or below has been dropped and it requires Java version 11 or higher to use the emulators. This is because Firebase Tools is built on top of other libraries that are now requiring Java 11.Regarding downloading Java 11 for MacOS, it can be a bit tricky. Oracle's website recommends downloading Java 8 Update 331 for MacOS, but it also has Java SE 11 available for download. However, the naming and packaging of Java 11 can be confusing, as it is referred to as both \"Java SE 11\" and \"Java Development Kit (JDK) 11\", with the latter version including both the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the development tools.In previous releases of the JDK, installing it on Windows or MacOS would also install the JRE. However, in JDK 11, this is no longer an option and you would need to install the JRE separately.It's important to note that, Java JDK is required for developers to develop Java based applications, where as JRE is only used to run applications developed on Java JDK.It's recommend to download JDK 11 from the official Oracle website, to make sure you have both JRE and SDK. You can find it under the Java SE Development Kit 11 Downloads page."}]}

I would now provide you the following sections from the company's (company name is ECCO) annual report and I want you to generate 3 objectives and 4 Key Results for each objective and the departments that should be owning each of those objectives. \n\n1.

RISK MANAGEMENT \n\nCEO’S REPORT\nAs I write my Annual Report, no one knows how the war in Ukraine will end. We have repeatedly condemned the unacceptable bombing of civilians in Ukraine and wish the war will end as soon as possible. ECCO’s heart is our people. Through many years, ECCO has experienced different crises. Our first concern has always been for the welfare of our employees. We have helped them through the crises and beyond, and we feel morally bound to also do the same now. If ECCO closed our business in the Russian market, we would send our 1,800 staff and their relatives, probably about 5,000 people in all, on the street. Also, thousands of other jobs would be lost across the world in our factories, shops, and offices, as ECCO is one of the very few in the industry who controls the majority of our value chain and produces leathers and shoes in our own tanneries and factories. Turning to 2021, it was a year with many challenges for ECCO. We sadly lost colleagues across the world to the COVID-19 pandemic. They will be missed. Our entire supply chain was shaken. Freight disturbances, factories running at lower efficiency due to COVID-19, and a lot of unpredictability on raw material supply. More than ever, we appreciated owning our own supply chain from tanneries to distribution. We managed to keep cancellations of orders to less than 1%. We have seen growth in all areas of our business. The shift in consumer behaviour towards digital channels is a new reality. ECCO’s investments in and focus on this distribution showed payback with 42% growth. Direct-to-consumer sales grew by 35%. A very encouraging development. ECCO’s sales in China continued to outperform with constant growth. The integration of the Russian business, acquired in 2019, went well thanks to an impressive performance by the new management and staff. Turkey and the Middle East showed very encouraging growth and a direct-to-consumer focus. Our performance in Europe and the US improved compared to 2020, but it is still unsatisfactory. ECCO’s new management is focusing on the transformation of the company - a transformation which is coming from inside the company. A total rethink of the way we do things. The focus is on simplicity, clarity, and streamlining of all areas of the business. A modern value chain set-up from idea to the consumer. A stronger brand, a clear brand identity, and a more focused brand. A brand which talks more to its consumers and is closer to the consumer with a renewed look. A digital transformation in all areas of our business will enable us to work smarter and react to data, producing a cleaner and focused product range. Our commitments to innovation and quality remain of very high priority. In 2020, we formalised our environmental targets towards 2030. We are proud of achieving the first milestone for 2024, in 2022 already. Our responsible attitude towards the environment is intensified, and many new projects leading to better and cleaner products and ways of working are on their way. We are looking with confidence towards the future, and towards a modern and rethought ECCO. An ECCO transformed from its own core and by its own people. Our ECCO.\n \nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nCOVID-19 disrupted production in ECCO’s factories and regrettably loss of life occurred. Supply chains were massively affected. Freight rates increased to historic heights and delays were frequent. In spite of this, ECCO returned to growth. Sales grew by 11.5% to EUR 1,218m, and operating margin increased to 6.9% from 4.6% in 2020. ECCO’s profit before tax ended at EUR 42.8m, slightly below 2020. It was, however, affected by an extraordinary event – the merger of ECCO’s European wholesale and retail activities. This led to EUR 13m in profits on shoes sold to the previously independent retail activities being carried back, as well as losses being absorbed and goodwill written off. Before this transaction, profit before tax stood at EUR 75.8m. Despite continued adverse conditions for footwear sales in 2021, ECCO secured a currency neutral growth of 35% in direct-to consumer channels with strong e-commerce growth of 42% over 2020. This was driven not only by owned and operated e-commerce, but also continued growth on third-party online market places. Retail sales partially recovered from 2020, but prolonged COVID-19 related lockdowns continued to be a challenge. Shoe sales grew by 11% with a 7.5% growth in volume sold and stronger price realisation. This led to net sales prices increasing by 2%, helping to offset the margin impact from continued high freight rates and inflationary cost pressure. Leather sales grew by 22% with record volumes of leather sold. Sales of shoe related accessories grew by 15% compared to 2020. The ECCO Leather Goods business was relaunched in 2021 with a stronger collection targeted at a more premium range of the segment. Geographically, ECCO realised good growth across all regions. The North American markets were hardest hit in 2020, but also experienced the strongest recovery in 2021 with sales growing by 26%. The Asia Pacific region with heavy reliance on retail and tourism experienced a growth in sales of 15% despite continued lockdowns in key markets. Greater China, ECCO’s most successful region, was largely unaffected by COVID-19 in 2021 and showed a solid growth of 19% in sales compared to 2020. ECCO Europe was challenged by weaker demand and supply disruptions impacting wholesale activities, which declined by 2%. Direct-to-consumer sales in Europe showed recovery versus the prior year with sales growing by 10% as a result. Investments for the year 2021 were EUR 89.8m. The Group ended the year with lower levels of working capital, mostly from reduced receivables. A strong focus in 2021 on reducing aged inventory saw inventory of shoes reducing by more than half a million pairs versus prior year. ECCO ended 2021 with healthier levels of current inventory with valuation of inventories increased by 5% compared to 2020; hence with a sales uplift of 10%, the inventory turn was increased. PROFIT & LOSS The year saw an increase over prior year in volume and sales, and top line growth rates were higher in the first half of the year when the prior year’s pandemic impacts were most severe. In terms of profitability, the recovery was stronger in the latter part of 2021 and in the final four months, profitability returned to expected levels with double-digit profit margins. Throughout the year, the business successfully directed efforts towards the online channels to meet the consumers where they were, while strengthening the interaction between offline and online channels. Omnichannel functionalities were introduced in several markets during 2021, driving additional sales and supporting the consumer journey. Total net sales of shoes and accessories increased by 10% compared to 2020. With the exception of the Europe region, all other regions saw double-digit growth. The US and Canada markets were the most severely impacted by COVID-19 in 2020, but also recovered the most in 2021. The Greater China region saw continued solid growth throughout 2021 with double-digit growth in all channels. As a consequence, the region’s share of total Group sales grew by 3% points to 33%. A highly promotional environment continued in many markets. Despite this, however, ECCO managed to secure a better price realisation on footwear sold.\n\nTo mitigate the anticipated supply disruptions, a significant increase in freight rates as well as retail lockdowns continuing in many markets, a cost saving plan was implemented in early 2021. The capacity cost base was well managed and increased by only EUR 35.3m (+7%) on a stronger recovering top line (+10%) and capacity costs as a percentage of sales dropped 1.9% points compared to 2020. Most of the increase in the capacity costs was caused by activity-driven costs like indirect production costs from higher production level and higher sales in the direct-to consumer channels. Depreciations and amortisation increased to EUR 70.0m (compared to EUR 68.9m in 2020) and hence, were almost flat compared to 2020. Profitability saw a substantial improvement in 2021 coming from all channels. Retail regained profitability, and e-commerce continued the positive trend and strong result. BALANCE SHEET & CASHFLOW Cash from operating activities increased to EUR 185m from EUR 32m in 2020. The profitable result and the improved working capital were the main reasons for the positive operational cashflow. Net working capital (trade receivables, inventories, and accounts payable) declined by a total of EUR 38m. Cashflow from investing activities was EUR 89.8m. Major investments were related to the IT integration and re-platforming of the Russian and European businesses, a new PLM system, technology infrastructure, and renovations. The Group cash position increased by 25%, and Return on equity improved by 1.1% points versus prior year. OUTLOOK The outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022 impacts ECCO’s business in Eastern Europe. The Ukraine business with annual sales of EUR 15m is expected to be lost in the outlook for 2022. Furthermore, it impacts Russia/Belarus, where ECCO operates above 220 shops with over 1,800 employees. The current unfortunate situation will negatively influence the financial performance for ECCO in 2022. It is at current not possible to estimate the impact; however, management is very confident that ECCO will remain financially strong at the end of 2022. Other markets are currently not impacted by the war, and ECCO expects these markets in 2022 to maintain a positive growth compared to 2021. The COVID-19 impact is expected to continue to subside. At the same time, new challenges will continue into 2022 with primarily supply side challenges on inflation in material prices and higher freight costs. Significant investments will be directed to relevant commercial opportunities with strong return on capital expected. Isolated from the Eastern Europe conflict, ECCO’s net sales and profitability are expected to significantly increase in 2022. The net profit in 2022 and financial status end of 2022 depend on the development in Eastern Europe and consequently, a more precise outlook is not possible to estimate currently.\n \nECCO’S UNIQUE VALUE CHAIN\nECCO’s founder was a true shoemaker. He built his business on the quality and durability of his shoes and was very innovative. He was among the first to design and develop casual shoes with great comfort and good fit. But Karl Toosbuy was also focused on production and constantly improving the processes in his factories. At a very early stage, the focus on production of quality shoes in a top-tuned production became ECCO’s strength. The second phase was the contact to ECCO’s customers. For many years, ECCO sold primarily through distributors and agents, but we slowly took over this business ourselves and became retailers rather than wholesalers. We now have a supply chain from the hides to the end-user. This was rather unique in the industry and a great advantage. ECCO did not depend on others in the main areas of our business, and in good years could make a profit along the supply chain – in the tanneries, the shoe factories, and in ECCO’s shops and e-commerce. But this strength becomes a weakness in crisis periods. Then ECCO can lose money – in all activities. The supply chain still has advantages. We are able to deliver normally to our customers, when competitors have big supply problems. We have now in our transformation process entered phase three of our unique value chain. Databased facts are used to define new collections. Designers now can develop with new insights in our customers’ preference – and we can shorten our supply chain by ordering new collections earlier and produce them faster. And we will at all times have full visibility of the process.\n\nECCO GLOBAL SALES\nSales started to pick up in early 2021 and regained momentum compared to the previous year. However, returning to ‘normal’ is to ECCO considered an illusion. Instead, new ways of communicating with consumers have appeared in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ways which moved ECCO even closer to the markets and increased the direct consumer engagement. Technology and a personal touch are to be combined to cater for a more comfortable consumer experience no matter the channel. Achieving a 35% growth in the direct-to-consumer channel is encouraging. The shift of consumer behaviour towards the digital channels continued to accelerate during 2021. In response, ECCO continued to invest significantly in better and faster technologies including improved IT infrastructures and consumer-facing touch-points. New organisations and dedicated teams responsible for lifting ECCO’s technological capabilities were established and expanded during 2021 and will constitute a key pillar in ECCO’s digital transformation in the years to come. Due to the continued investment in e-commerce, consumers were still able to access products online when shops temporarily were closed. This element is part of the digital acceleration which continues to take place, focusing on the digital consumer journey across all ECCO platforms and touch-points to ensure the consistency of the brand experience. Our dedicated teams in shops continued to ensure a safe shopping experience for consumers throughout 2021 with markets offering appointment shopping as well as an ever-increasing touchpoint through social media. ECCO has supported the retail industry in all our markets through the opening of pop-up locations, using the opportunity of unused space in malls and high streets to support the growth of the brand’s footprint. Retail locations will remain key to providing class-leading service and brand experience, and the opening of pop-up locations shows the belief ECCO has in the future of physical retail locations and our willingness to invest. Focus on learning and development of staff remains a key focus for ECCO. Growth of our online training platform has enabled the retail teams to continue their learning and development to provide an even better service moving forward. Through a focus on marketing, ECCO looks to communicate better with our wide range of consumers through more targeted marketing campaigns and investments in digital touch-points.\n\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE Annual Report 2021 \n\n1.

We base our business model on consumer data, inhouse innovation, research and development, leather tanning, and shoe production; ending with sales and distribution through partner retailers, online, and our more than 2,200 shops worldwide. During the entire journey, our shoes go through no less than 220 pairs of hands of skilled ECCO employees. Based on the data collected, ECCO shoes are sketched in the hands of our designers, who work closely with our research, development, and innovation teams to refine and create new products that bring comfort and quality to our consumers. We are innovative by nature and continuously invest in new technologies. Our portfolio spans a wide range of products in the footwear segment as well as in the leather goods segment. Leather is a core part of our product heritage and value proposition. While most of the leather we develop and produce goes to footwear production, a significant part of the output of our ECCO Leather business goes to third-party manufacturers who seek ECCO for our reliable production processes and commitment to quality and innovation. The backbone of our global supply chain is our shoe factories. Located in Europe and Asia, the shoe factories are often co-located with our tanneries, ensuring that ECCO has end-to-end control of the footwear development and production process. The factories deploy state-of-the-art technologies to complement more than 50 years of craftmanship and experience in making high-quality shoes where function follows the foot. Our finished products leave warehouses and distribution centres for the final journey to ECCO’s shops, online channels, or retail partners around the world. We take great pride in our business model, but we never stop working to improve it. In 2021, we took decisive steps to further strengthen our business model with a number of transformative activities. We completed the integration and simplification of our European wholesale and retail activities under one management team, thus ensuring greater transparency and reducing complexity of coordination to the benefit of our consumers. We completed the plan for a multiyear digital transformation with the aim of overhauling our systems and processes and embedding digital capabilities closer to the business. Over the next five years, ECCO will fundamentally scale the digitalisation of our end-to-end business model. We furthered our innovation into materials and production technologies to ensure the transformation of our supply chain capabilities and to embed our environmental targets ever increasingly into our value chain. \nOur future factory concepts, like the Factory 2025, are maturing at an increasing rate. These upstream innovations will soon be available to meet the increasing consumer demand for speed, quality, and sustainability. Our operating model is strongly rooted in our Code of Conduct. We emphasise respect for our surroundings and towards the places and the people with whom we do business. We are committed to good corporate conduct by design as the Code of Conduct pervades all our decisions. ECCO has always and will continue to work hard to contribute to global and regional environmental goals.\n \nRISK MANAGEMENT \nECCO is exposed to a number of business risks that may adversely impact our ability to reach our financial and strategic objectives. In pursuing business opportunities, ECCO consciously takes on certain risks, but effective risk management enables the ECCO Group to continuously monitor them and implement appropriate countermeasures. However, even with vigorous preparation and planning, there is a risk that pandemics might occur in the future and damage the business. The Supervisory Board is ultimately accountable for ECCO’s risk management. Key risks are examined by the Managing Board and the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis and, if necessary, the Managing Board and the Audit Committee delegate mitigation responsibility. Significant risks include cyber security, tax risks, internal supply chain disruption, illegal use of ECCO’s IPR, and financial risks. CYBER RISKS The potential consequences of cyber-attacks can be substantial, ranging from data breaches to direct financial losses, business interruption, and damage to ECCO’s brand reputation. To mitigate the risks, ECCO continues to invest in countermeasures and takes the necessary steps to prevent, detect, and respond to potential cyber threats. In 2021, we saw a continued increase in cyber criminality. Increased awareness and training programmes enhanced our first line of defence, our employees, enabling them to spot and report threats more efficiently. Controls were strengthened across the technical areas, and the cyber risk team was strengthened in line with the increasing threat picture. TAX RISKS The global tax policy landscape has undergone dramatic changes over the past several years and continued to do so in 2021. ECCO’s global presence, and a significant number of intercompany transactions, increase the exposure to challenging tax evolutions and in this increasingly uncertain environment, double taxation continues to be a tangible threat. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a major decline in tax revenue in many countries, which increases the risk of more disputes with tax authorities as a consequence of the needs for governments to address deficits debt stemming. To mitigate this risk in the best possible way, ECCO continues to follow the OECD guidelines in its price setting for all transactions, supported by secure and timely transfer pricing documentation. ECCO is renewing an existing bilateral advance pricing agreement between Denmark and Indonesia, and is finalising a similar agreement between Denmark and the US. INTERNAL SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION ECCO’s tanneries, factories, and shops are co-dependent, and a disruption in one area may adversely affect the entire value chain and, most notably, sales to consumers. For example, a factory fire or natural catastrophe could significantly affect the Group’s operations. ECCO’s prepared mitigations include measures to prevent fires, various contingency plans, and suitable insurance cover. In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to cause some disruption to ECCO’s internal supply chain. The effects were again mitigated by our ownership or control of the entire shoemaking and sales process, from the tanning of hides, to shoe production, and sales of products to our consumers. Owning our own factories carries financial risk associated with disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our factories in Asia saw periodic closure from COVID-19 related circumstances, whereas we saw European factories less affected in 2021, highlighting simultaneously the risk-mitigating benefits for ECCO of our global production footprint being geographically diverse. ILLEGAL USE OF ECCO IPR ECCO’s Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are core assets due to their essential and considerable value. ECCO’s IPR strategy ensures that we are able to carry out our business activities unhindered, to achieve competitive advantages, and to maintain and further develop our position in global markets. ECCO is constantly alert to the ongoing threat of individuals or companies that may try to penetrate, or copy, ECCO’s IPR and brand. This could potentially lead to a loss of competitive advantage, or damage the perception of the ECCO brand. In ECCO, we therefore protect our brand, designs, and new technical developments as rigorously as possible through patents, trademarks, copyrights, design rights, and trade secrets. In addition, ECCO constantly monitors our products, both online and offline. When required, we rigorously defend our IPR against copycats and other infringements through administrative and legal actions. In 2021, ECCO successfully enforced our IPR in many jurisdictions, leading to cancellation of thirdparty registrations, compensation, prevention of sales, and acknowledgement of ECCO’s rights. In 2021, ECCO invested significantly and increasingly in innovations, and these are protected by patent applications. IMPACT FROM FINANCIAL MARKETS ECCO’s Corporate Treasury has overall responsibility for financial risk management, arranging currency hedging and ensuring adequate credit facilities to mitigate fluctuations in Net Working Capital, if needed, and to even out sales patterns that traditionally have two annual peaks. ECCO maintains an appropriate degree of financial headroom, which acts as a buffer in situations that could affect income and net working capital. The Corporate Treasury functions as ECCO’s internal bank, providing loans and deposits within the Group. ECCO is globally exposed to fluctuations in currency rates, and the Corporate Treasury maximises natural hedging whenever possible, respecting regulations and practicalities. Our Currency Policy ensures that the material part of transactional exposures is hedged. ECCO’s hedge horizon has a range of 12 to 27 months, depending on the nature of the underlying exposure. To reduce the risk of increased financing costs, ECCO manages the interest rate risk by taking up fixed-rate loans or by entering into interest rate swaps. DATA ETHICS In ECCO, we care about creating and maintaining strong, positive relationships with our colleagues, our partners, and our customers and we therefore always strive to process data in an ethical manner and with respect for the individual. ECCO is collecting and processing more and more data about our employees, consumers, customers, and other partners and since ECCO is continuously using new technologies to improve its value chain and the consumer and customer experiences, ECCO makes a clear commitment to always collect and process data in accordance with high ethical standards. In ECCO, we are currently implementing our Data Ethics Policy and in 2022 will be working diligently with the implementation hereof to ensure we honour the commitment. Managing data protection obligations has come into clearer focus over the past years due to additional regulatory requirements imposed in the EU through GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation. To comply with this regulation, ECCO continuously evaluates the maturity level of our data protection and offers our employees appropriate GDPR training. An action plan is in place to mitigate any vulnerability disclosed in our protection of data. ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS We realise that our activities have environmental impacts when we tan leathers, make shoes, and transport our products. We cannot change this entirely. But we will always work hard to minimise our impact on the environment. The greatest risks to the environment from ECCO’s operations and activities come from energy consumption, water management, air pollution, etc. ECCO’s operations depend on changes to legislation or regulations, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, or human-made environmental disasters. Furthermore, ECCO’s financial performance may be affected by potential changes in natural resource prices due to scarcity or inconsistent supply of raw materials, for example. REPUTATIONAL RISKS ECCO also appreciates that environmental risks are becoming of increasing importance to executives, investors, and regulators and aims to be more transparent in our risk identification and management processes."}]}
